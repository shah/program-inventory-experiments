Cooperative Extension Service,(CES),"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, AGRICULTURE, DEPARTMENT OF","GENERAL: [As reflected in Part I,B. of the Request for Applications (RFA) or Capacity Requests for Applications (Capacity RFA)]
1. Smith-Lever (3b) & (c) Capacity Grants (formerly known as Formula Funds)

a)  Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (formerly known as 3b & c Formula Funds)  
These funds are used by institutions eligible to receive funds under the Act of Congress approved July second, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, entitled ‘‘An Act donating public lands to the several States and Territories which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts’’ (Twelfth Statutes at Large, page five hundred and three) (“1862 Land-grant Institutions”), for the development of practical applications of research knowledge and giving of instruction and practical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or technologies in agriculture, uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home economics, and rural energy, and subjects relating thereto to persons not attending or resident in 1862 Land-grant Institutions in the several communities, and imparting information on those subjects through demonstrations, publications, and otherwise and for the necessary printing and distribution of information in connection with the subjects.
The purpose of this funding is to conduct agricultural extension work.

(b)  Cooperative Extension Programs at 1862 Land-Grant Institutions (Special Needs) –  
The purpose of this funding is to increase the level of agricultural extension work. These funds are used to support extension activities identified in the eligible institution’s approved 5-Year Plan of Work. Special Needs funds are allocated to a State Cooperative Extension Service to fulfill a purpose or overcome a condition peculiar to the State, as compared to the country as a whole, or for a purpose not normally a part of the continuing extension program.

(c) Smith-Lever Special Needs Program  
Funds support innovative extension education approaches to addressing risks, hazards and disasters. The Cooperative Extension Service (CES) has an important role in reducing the impact of disasters through extension education. The Extension Special Needs program sponsors targeted projects that enable CES to assist in preparing for, providing an educational response to, and recovering from disasters. Education programming funded by this program will help communities, families and individuals become more self-sustaining by strengthening and increasing their resiliency to disaster. Some types of hazards and disaster related events funded in previous years include uncertainties caused by losses of economic infrastructure, severe weather or other natural disasters, security breaches, human disease, or high consequence animal diseases and plant pests.

There has been an increase in public awareness regarding the number and severity of disaster type critical incidents involving earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, contagious disease, and terrorist events. The National Academy of Sciences Committee on Environment and Natural Resources and the Subcommittee on Disaster Reduction of the National Science and Technology Council have acknowledged the many effective roles that the Cooperative Extension System (CES) has played in disaster preparedness, response and remediation. 

Within the states and territories, the CES has repeatedly served as the trusted community organization that has helped to enable families, communities, and businesses to successfully prepare for, respond to and cope with disaster losses and critical incidents. Once a disaster has occurred, the local extension outreach includes: 1) Communicating practical science-based risk information, 2) Developing relevant educational experiences and programs, 3) Working with individuals and communities to open new communication channels, and 4) Mitigating losses and facilitating recovery. Never was this more evident than after hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and during the 2008 Midwestern Summer flooding. During and after these incidents, local Extension agents served as a critical communication node throughout affected urban and rural areas, particularly when traditional communication systems were temporarily overwhelmed or destroyed. 

The Extension Special Needs RFA encourages proposals that specifically address one or more of the following six key target areas: 

1. Education and Technical assistance through inter-disciplinary and multi-state disaster training programs and demonstration projects for problem solving, especially those which build upon already existing strengths, contribute to or expand the EDEN and/or eXtension educational materials related to disaster preparation, mitigation, response and recovery; 

2. Collaboration with Federal, state and local agencies and other disaster relief organizations to support education and service activities that enhance recovery of impacted rural communities, schools, businesses and agricultural-based activities; 

3. Long range family, community and regional planning projects that will enhance implementation of programs that serve public needs in preparation for, during and after emergency situations within impacted States and across impacted regions; 

4. Communication delivery of key information that meets end-users’ needs in a timely fashion with consideration of potentially limited communication channels due to disaster situations; 

5. Dissemination of credible, science-based information that is reliable and easily accessible even if electronic access is compromised; and 

6. Integrated Research and Extension Planning Projects (up to $15,000) are intended to provide assistance to applicants in bringing together teams for the development of highly competitive grant proposals where extension personnel would apply for large grants (in excess of $250,000) from other grant programs (e.g., the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative and etc…) and lead nationally important disaster prevention, protection and mitigation projects. 

Fundable projects should support education and extension activities which: 

1. Reduce risk through planning, disaster preparedness and emergency response by improving communication between the public, community leaders, state and Federal agencies; 

2. Develop strategies and educational materials and/or programming in the area of emergency planning, infrastructure design and disaster recovery operation; 

3. Develop community networks that provide real-time disaster education information; and/or 

4. Develop or expand educational materials regarding disaster issues suitable for use and distribution by the Extension Disaster Education Network (EDEN) or the eXtension Community of Practice working with disaster planning.

Through this competitive cooperative agreement, the University of Illinois has developed a national-level surveillance system that addresses the previous gaps in surveillance by federally and non-federally funded systems and surveys.  

Three major federal-level surveillance systems and surveys were in place at the time this agreement was awarded; each was expected to continue for at least another 2-3 years, if not indefinitely. Each of these surveillance systems and surveys is funded by a government agency, and each collects detailed data on the breadth and depth of existing state laws, district policies, and related school practices; the implementation of said laws, policies, and practices; and their effects on student health outcomes. The next section describes the strengths, primary areas of focus, periodicity, and other key characteristics for each of three major national surveillance systems and surveys. In so doing, it also highlights important gaps in what they cover, individually and collectively, and areas where linkage with other relevant surveys or research efforts is able to provide a more detailed picture of school wellness policies and their effects.

1. School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study/School Nutrition Dietary Assessment
The School Nutrition Dietary Assessment (SNDA) is administrated by the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) every 5 years and collects and analyzes nationally representative data on school meals and the school meal environment (including competitive foods) at the district- and school-levels, with individual-level dietary information collected every 10 years.SNDA-V was administered as the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS) in SY 2014-2015 and includes SNDA-type meal assessment data as well as data on meal cost, dietary recall, plate waste, and meals’ compliance with standards.

SNDA/SNMCS is the only assessment that examines specifically the nutritional quality of school meals, how and if those meals are meeting the new standards, and meal cost. Examining SNDA/SNMCS data together with state law and district policy data, which SNDA does not currently collect, has the potential to demonstrate how the laws and policies at the state- and district-level are being implemented in, or affecting, lunchrooms (with regard to meal planning and meal environment) and students (with regard to meal cost and diet).

2. Classification of Laws Associated with School Students
The National Cancer Institute’s Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (C.L.A.S.S.) is a policy classification system that can be used to evaluate state-level codified laws for nutrition and physical education in schools across all 50 states and the District of Columbia by grade level. C.L.A.S.S. uses state law as the data source and scores the concordance between state laws and national school wellness policy mandates. C.L.A.S.S. data are publicly available for use by researchers, policy makers, and school administrators to obtain information on state laws associated with childhood obesity, track policy changes over time, test relationships between law and behavior, associate C.L.A.S.S. scores with state- and school district-policies, and link to information about obesity and other cancer-related behaviors. C.L.A.S.S. also offers two data visualization tools: (1) a map function that depicts the strength of specific policy areas by grade level across states, and (2) a profile function that depicts policy scores across grade levels within each state by year.

While C.L.A.S.S. is the only classification system that objectively scores state laws on nutritional and physical activity, it does not identify specific elements of the state laws. Therefore, additional, complementary research is required to parse out and examine relationships between individual policy components (e.g., addressing sugar or fat content in school foods) and related school practices and student outcomes (e.g., diet, physical activity, BMI).

3.  School Health Policies and Practices Study
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS) is a national, comprehensive survey conducted to assess school wellness at the state-, district-, school-, and classroom-levels. SHPPS surveys cover health education, physical education, health services, mental health and social services, nutrition services, healthy and safe school environments, and faculty and staff health promotion. Due to the comprehensive design of SHPPS, wellness policy data may be linked with other school health data. SHPPS data are collected every two years, alternating school- and classroom-level data collection with district-level data collection. In 2014, SHPPS collected school- and classroom-level data, and in the following cycle (2016) it collected district-level data. 

SHPPS is unique in monitoring both school health policies and school wellness policies, which is essential for linking LWPs to student health outcomes such as services received, safety, and environments. The multi-level aspect of SHPPS assessments presents the opportunity for linking this data with state law data in order to show the effects of state laws on LWPs, and the effects of LWPs on overall health. However, SHPPS data are not collected annually. 

Great progress has been made in adopting school wellness policies and in developing surveillance systems to monitor their implementation and impact. Yet continued progress in school wellness, school wellness policy development, and positive impacts requires surveillance that provides a fuller understanding of the strengths and limitations of current policies, and that chart the course for evidence-based improvements. This competitive cooperative agreement provides a national-level surveillance system that addresses the most important gaps in the coverage of the existing school wellness policy surveillance systems and surveys by: 

 - linking enacted school district wellness policy and related state law data with data being collected through other existing surveillance systems (e.g., SNDA, CLASS, SHPPS) in 2014-2015;
- conducting a nationwide evaluation of the scope of “on-the-books” (enacted) school district wellness policies and related state laws;
- collecting and analyzing qualitative data that can explore the implementation of and compliance with NSLA policies across various stakeholders (e.g., administrators, school food authorities, parents, children, etc.); and
- developing and disseminating timely policy briefs, fact sheets, and other translation products (e.g., infographics) to inform the USDA, Congress, and the research field of key school wellness policy surveillance results and gaps as well as to produce papers for peer-reviewed publication."

Public Television Station Digital Transition Grant Program,,"RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE, AGRICULTURE, DEPARTMENT OF","As part of the nation's transition to digital television, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required all television broadcasters to convert their transmitters to broadcast digital signals by June 12, 2009.  The goal of this conversion was a television system that makes more efficient use of the radio spectrum. Decreasing the use of spectrum by television channels freed up spectrum to enable the introduction of new wireless telecommunications services such as mobile wireless Internet access. In order to allocate spectrum to new uses, stations had to transition their main transmitter to the new broadcast system and digital no later than June 2009.  While stations must broadcast their main transmitter signal in digital, many rural stations have yet to complete a full digital transition of their stations across all equipment.  Rural stations often have translators serving small or isolated areas.  The 2009 FCC deadline did not apply to translators; in 2011 the FCC adopted a final deadline for analog-to-digital conversion of all translators by September 1, 2015.  Because of this, translators have been allowed to continue broadcasting in analog, and stations are still in the process of converting some of their translators to digital. Some rural stations also have not fully converted their production and studio equipment to digital, which has impaired their ability to provide the same quality local programming that they provided in analog.  The digital transition has also created some service gaps where households that received an analog signal are now unable to receive a digital signal.  For rural households the digital transition has meant in some cases diminished over-the-air public television service.  These rural households are the focus of the Agency’s Public Television Station Digital Transition Grant Program."

To facilitate CEDS, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to the designated planning organization (e.g., District Organization) serving EDA-designated Economic Development Districts (EDDs) throughout the Nation.  These planning organizations are typically recognized by the State in which they reside as multi-jurisdictional councils of governments, regional commissions, or planning and development centers.  Partnership Planning grants enable planning organizations to manage and coordinate the development and implementation of CEDS.  In addition, EDA provides Partnership Planning grants to Indian Tribes to help organize and assist with the implementation of economic development activities within their areas.  The majority of funding under the Planning program is for Partnership Planning grants for Indian Tribes and EDA-designated EDDs.

The Planning program also helps support planning organizations and other eligible recipients, including District Organizations and Indian Tribes, with Short-Term and State Planning efforts in order to stimulate and guide the creation and/or retention of higher-skill, higher-wage jobs, particularly for the unemployed and underemployed in the Nation’s most economically distressed regions.  For example, EDA might provide Short-Term Planning funding to a coalition of Tribal and regional organizations to plan a coordinated response to the sudden loss of a major employer in the affected area(s).

Objectives:  There are currently over 2.2 million individuals serving time in federal and state prisons, and millions of people cycle through local jails every year. Of those in state and federal prison, approximately 95 percent will be released and return to communities across the nation. A majority of these individuals have needs that, if unaddressed in prison, during the reentry process, and after release, will negatively impact their ability to live productive, pro-social, crime-free lives in the community. These needs include housing and employment challenges, relationship and family issues, and substance abuse and mental health problems.

The Second Chance Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-199) helps to address these significant challenges by providing comprehensive responses to the significant number of incarcerated adults who are returning to communities from prison, jail, and juvenile residential facilities. Programs funded under the Second Chance Act help to promote public safety by ensuring that the transition individuals make from prison and jail to the community is successful.

Smart Prosecution Initiative,IPI,"OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS, JUSTICE, DEPARTMENT OF","Goals: 

The goal of Innovative Prosecution Solutions (IPS) Initiative is to develop a body of knowledge about data-driven strategies—innovative, best practice, or evidenced-based—as they are implemented by prosecutors. BJA sought applications from state, local, or tribal prosecutor agencies interested in testing data-driven approaches that address one or more of the following three goals:

•	Promoting fair, impartial, and expeditious pursuit of justice;
•	Ensuring safe communities; 
•	Promoting integrity in the prosecution profession and effective coordination in the criminal justice system;
•	Test, establish, and/or expand innovative new ideas and evidence-based programming in the office to increase prosecutors’ ability to effectively and sustainably prevent and respond to crime, especially violent crime;
•	Establish sustainable research partnerships that are integrated into the strategic and tactical operations of agencies;
•	Foster effective, formalized, and consistent collaborations with external agencies, and with the communities in which they serve, to increase public safety;
•	Use technology, intelligence, and data in innovative ways that enable the office to focus resources on the people and places associated with high concentrations of criminal behavior and crime; and
•	Advance the state of the prosecution practice for the benefit of the entire field through dissemination of promising practices and evaluation findings.

Objectives:

The IPS initiative seeks to encourage exploration of new solutions to public safety concerns, as well as address internal operations and organizational structure of prosecutor’s offices. The program is intended to support prosecutors as leaders among their criminal justice partners and develop criminal justice strategies focused on reducing violent crime.  Below are some creative solutions implemented by prosecutors around the country that centered on issue areas that assist with the prioritization of cases as well as:

•	Developing ways to identify the most violent repeat offenders; 
•	Developing mechanisms to prosecute individuals who are responsible for opioid related deaths or the sale of drugs leading to overdoses;
•	Using data to develop zone/geographic prosecution;
•	Using crime analysis tools, through strategies like GunStat, to track violence involving the criminal use of a firearm;
•	Developing policies to prosecute witness intimidation cases;
•	Working jointly with parole and probation departments on violations of probation;
•	Enhancing the prosecutor’s role in investigations of homicide cases and cybercrime strategies to improve public safety; and
•	Working jointly with police and the United States Attorney to develop formal process to prioritize cases for the most appropriate venue for prosecution.

There are several core elements must be in place to support a successful IPS Initiative. These include strong executive support for the project within the prosecutor’s office; sophisticated problem and data analysis efforts; and a commitment to making organizational and operational changes to sustain the strategies found to be successful, as measured by the project’s evaluation. Under the IPS Initiative, prosecutors are also strongly encouraged to partner with a researcher, and to establish innovative and effective working relationships with citizens and community leaders to gain support for the prosecutors’ proposed initiatives. Agencies are also expected to leverage data from other criminal justice entities—such as parole, probation, corrections, the judiciary, and law enforcement agencies—to aid in their activities.

As prosecutors implement innovative, best practices or evidenced-based approaches to address the goals listed below, there is a need to evaluate their efforts. The IPS Initiative seeks to encourage exploration of new solutions to public safety concerns, as well as internal operations and organizational structure, while employing research partners at the problem definition stage through assessment of strategies and solutions."

Justice Reinvestment Initiative,JRI,"OFFICE OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS, JUSTICE, DEPARTMENT OF","Goals: 

Under the enacted appropriations language, the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI), is to “reduce crime and recidivism.” JRI helps state, local, and tribal jurisdictions to identify and respond to crime and other public safety problems, explore evidence-based or innovative and cost-saving strategies, and to invest in strategies that can decrease crime and reduce recidivism.

Objectives:

JRI technical assistance supports states’ justice system stakeholders and policy leaders as they devise and implement data-driven approaches to reduce crime and recidivism, including operationalizing data results to reduce violent crime and supporting state and local agencies in their efforts to do the same. Under the JRI model, a governmental working group with bipartisan and inter-branch representation analyzes the crime, recidivism, and corrections data, and its associated costs, then develops cost- effective policy and practice options, and implements and measures those changes. JRI jurisdictions invest in high-performing initiatives that make communities safer. JRI encourages states to embrace a culture of greater collaboration, data-driven decision-making and increased use of evidence-based practices.

The Justice Reinvestment:  Reducing Violent Crime by Improving Justice System Performance program has been developed to support these goals by helping to build state and local jurisdictions’ and tribes’ capacity to analyze, identify, and respond to drivers of both violent crime and high cost (Category 1) and test innovative tools to facilitate coordinated information sharing and analysis among justice partners (Category 2).

The objectives of the site-based JR program are the following:

Category 1
•	Collect and analyze data, and identify and respond to crime and cost drivers.
•	Engage stakeholders across the justice system (e.g., law enforcement, jails, treatment providers) to diagnose and develop coordinated responses. 
•	Test, establish, and/or expand innovative ideas and evidence-based strategies to prevent and respond to crime. 

Category 2
•	Break down information sharing silos and challenge current practices that may impede a community’s violent crime reduction strategies.
•	Develop comprehensive and integrated data-sharing and notification systems about violent offenders moving into, between, or being released into their communities. 
•	Build data-analysis capacity and improve justice system partners’ abilities to produce a cross-system analysis that provides a better understanding of the contributions of pretrial, probation, parole, reentry, and other services to crime trends.

Successful applicants are expected to follow a five-step process to meet the objectives: engage stakeholders; analyze data and the current landscape; develop a plan, procedures, and strategies; implement responses; and measure outcomes."

Recognizing their sacrifice, Congress enacted laws to prevent veterans seeking Federal employment from being penalized for their time in military service. Veterans' preference recognizes the economic loss suffered by citizens who have served their country in uniform, restores veterans to a favorable competitive position for Government employment, and acknowledges the larger obligation owed to disabled veterans.  Veterans' preference is not so much a reward for being in uniform as it is a way to help make up for the economic loss suffered by those who answered the nation's call to arms. Historically, preference has been reserved by Congress for those who were either disabled or who served in combat areas. Eligible veterans receive many advantages in Federal employment, including preference for initial employment and a higher retention standing in the event of layoffs. However, the veterans' preference laws do not guarantee the veteran a job, nor do they give veterans' preference in internal agency actions such as promotion, transfer, reassignment, and reinstatement. By law, veterans who are disabled or who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns are entitled to preference over others in hiring from competitive lists of eligibles and also in retention during reductions-in-force. Preference applies in hiring for virtually all Federal jobs, whether in the competitive or excepted service.

Global Peace Operations Initiative ,GPOI,"STATE, DEPARTMENT OF, STATE, DEPARTMENT OF","GPOI was initially envisioned as a five-year program (FY 2005-2009) to help address major gaps in international capacity to conduct peace support operations (PSOs), with a focus on Africa.  Such gaps included a shortage of capable peacekeepers and formed police units (FPUs), limited national capabilities to train and sustain peacekeeping proficiencies, and a lack of international coordination mechanisms to assist the deployment of troop and police contingents to PSOs.  Despite considerable progress in these areas since FY 2005, significant capacity shortfalls continue to impact the effectiveness of United Nations (UN) and regional PSOs.  Addressing these gaps will require a long-term commitment to capacity building by the United States and other contributor countries.  Toward this end, a National Security Council Deputies Committee approved a five-year renewal of GPOI’s mandate (FY 2010-2014) in October 2008.  Through policy statements and budgetary allocations, the current Administration subsequently affirmed support for the continuation of PSO capacity building activities through GPOI.

Reflective of global PSO requirements at the time of GPOI’s establishment, the program’s first five years focused on significantly increasing the number of peacekeepers available for deployment.  Accordingly, the primary objective of “Phase I” was to train and, as appropriate, equip at least 75,000 peacekeepers by 2010.  GPOI met and, in fact, surpassed this target, training 86,969 peacekeepers as of 30 September 2009.  Through GPOI, the United States further provides deployment support, obligating $ 76.6 million to date to facilitate the equipping, transportation, and sustainment of troops deploying to various UN and regional missions.  Overall, GPOI train, equip, and deployment support activities have facilitated the deployment of 122,202 personnel from 31 countries to 19 PSOs around the world.

GPOI funds a wide range of regional capacity building initiatives, to include technical assistance, staff training, equipment provisions, and building refurbishments for two regional headquarters (the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)) and 32 national and regional PSO training centers.  Additionally, GPOI provides financial, technical, and staffing support to the Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (COESPU), an Italian-led center to facilitate the training of stability/formed police unit (FPU) trainers.  


During “Phase II” (FY 2010-2014), GPOI will seek to continue to ensure sufficient numbers of capable peacekeepers are available for PSOs, with the target of facilitating training for an additional 242,500 troops.  However, program emphasis has shifted from the direct training of peacekeepers by U.S. personnel to building sustainable, indigenous PSO training capabilities in partner countries/ organizations.  GPOI-funded activities emphasize the establishment and strengthening of partner countries’ training infrastructures, with a focus on both military troops and FPUs, where appropriate.  Accordingly, at least two-thirds (or approximately 162,500) of the peacekeepers trained will be trained indigenously by GPOI-trained instructors.  GPOI will further continue to serve as a mechanism for supporting units deploying to UN and regional peacekeeping missions, as well as to build the capacity of regional organizations to train for, plan, deploy, manage, sustain, and integrate lessons learned from PSOs.

Ozone Transport Commission,OTC,"ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY","The overall goal of the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) grant is to facilitate collaboration among the OTC jurisdictions, notably the State Environmental Commissioners/Secretaries, State Air Directors and their staff, to assist them in reducing ozone precursor emissions in their states and in representing their ozone related issues to the EPA. Without this collaboration, individual States would potentially be duplicating or recreating each other’s work, and face resource constraints to complete the work needed to attain and maintain the health-protective ozone standards in the region. The focus of the OTC is to ensure real results in air quality improvement in the Ozone Transport Region. The OTC brings together the State members to coordinate reductions in air pollution to benefit the entire region. These State officials have primary responsibility under the Clean Air Act for achieving the nation’s ambient air quality standards, including the standard for ozone pollution which is caused by oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds emissions with the region and ozone transported into the region from non-OTC states. The commission provides a forum where States collaboratively develop and share air pollution inventories and analyses, and engage in developing harmonized regional ozone pollution reduction strategies. The Ozone Transport Commission (OTC or the Commission) is the single regional multi-state organization created under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) responsible for advising the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on ground-level ozone and its precursor pollutant transport issues. The Commission is responsible by law for developing and implementing regional solutions to the ground-level ozone problem in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. As directed under the CAA, EPA awarded a grant to establish the Commission, and has subsequently maintained funding of the Commission with funds appropriated by the Congress to state and local air pollution control agencies under the authority of Section 106 of the CAA. Section 184 of the CAA established the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) that, by law, develops and recommends regional strategies for cleaning up air pollution.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2019:  The OTC states continue to face significant challenges in preparing SIPs for the attainment of the 2008 and the 2015 Ozone U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). These challenges are highlighted by the recent increases in monitored ozone levels and will require a greater level of regional support and coordination from the OTC. The member states rely on OTC work products, particularly sound science, to meet their individual SIP obligations. The coordinated and collaborative effort of OTC’s Committees represents the most efficient, cost effective, and in certain cases the only possible means to assemble all the necessary elements of an attainment plan for OTC States. The OTC will continue to take a leadership role in coordinating with other Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs), contributing States, and EPA offices to assist in the resolution of ozone transport issues under CAA section 110 (a)(2)(D). Despite many successes, large population areas within the OTR are remain in high need of focused efforts to provide health protections from high ozone exposure. The OTC Work Plan is focused on collaboration and partnerships that improve efficiency, effectiveness, and overall consistency among states in addressing ozone pollution in the region. Administratively, the OTC has continuously streamlined and modernized operations to provide the efficient and effective management of limited resources. The Modeling Committee facilitates the coordination of the photochemical modeling and emissions inventory work of the OTC States. The grant provides necessary technical resources to ensure management and technical assistance for this coordination among member states and collaboration with other states, EPA and stakeholders. The modeling work begins with developing an emissions inventory of ozone precursor emissions for a base year, along with a reproduced meteorological field for that same year. The emissions inventory and meteorological field data are processed and run through a photochemical model to “predict” the ozone readings at air quality monitors. These “predictions” are then compared to actual data on ozone levels collected at the monitors for the same period to validate the performance of the model. The modeling and emissions inventory work in the OTC is coordinated by the Modeling Committee to ensure that States are able to complete the work accurately and on time. Both the emissions inventory and modeling work are decentralized across States and other planning organizations, requiring considerable commitment of resources, coordination, and oversight. Ongoing activities include: Developing regional models of ozone concentrations in collaboration with the OTC States to achieve consistency in the final results. The OTC also coordinates with other RPOs, upwind States, and the EPA to achieve this goal. Improving the modeling tools available: The OTC also works to improve the suite of modeling tools available in order to make the process of modeling quicker, more transparent, and more accurate. OTC has also been a leader for an inter-regional effort to respond to the 110 good neighbor provisions required by the CAA. OTC has also initiated an effort to understand ozone patterns where land and water meet. This effort led to suggesting alternatives to how these areas could be represented in photochemical models. States and EPA are now actively working to prepare a new modeling platform and emissions inventories to help shape the technical support of policies and strategies to improve air quality.

Funding Priorities - Fiscal Year 2020:  The OTC focused and organized its activities and projects around the following priorities:  1) Promoting timely attainment of air quality goals and requirements in the Ozone Transport Region (OTR) by supporting faster and greater reductions of emissions from all pertinent stationary and area sources through polity mechanisms, including development of OTC’s multi-pollutant position, with an acute focus on technical and policy support for good neighborhood and infrastructure SIPs, and designations and classifications under the 2015 NAAQS for ozone; 2) Focusing greater attention on application and implementation of tighter emissions standards in the mobile sources and transportation sector and developing and implementing programs and tools to assist OTR states in achieving those standards; 3) Revising and implementing improved systems, including coordination with other multi-state organizations (MSOs) and their member states, to develop and manage information and sharing resources and mechanisms for states;  4) Improving and augmenting modeling and data analysis protocols and tools to assist OTR states in meeting new federal ozone requirements and identifying co-benefits that may accrue for meeting new federal PM requirements, and to help support and promote OTC policy positions;  5) Working in partnership with the EPA and encouraging EPA to use and implement the successful work of the OTC on a national basis; 6)  Tracking relevant regulatory and policy information nationally and in the region, and commenting accordingly;  7) Supporting and directing the work of the OTC committees; and 8) Exploring voluntary and cooperative.  The OTC will continue to take a leadership role in coordinating with other Regional Planning Organizations (RPOs), contributing States, and EPA offices to assist in the resolution of ozone transport issues under CAA section 110 (a)(2)(D).  Despite many successes, large population areas within the OTR are remain in high need of focused efforts to provide health protections from high ozone exposure. The OTC Work Plan is focused on collaboration and partnerships that improve efficiency, effectiveness, and overall consistency among states in addressing ozone pollution in the region."

HAP uses the best available science including strategic conservation, to improve the natural resources and socio-economic conditions in the Highlands. Strategic conservation aims to build networks and connections between high value ecosystems by protecting intact resources and enhancing or restoring other areas. This strategic approach provides a framework for revitalizing and connecting forested headwaters and lands through river corridors and natural stream channel design, wetlands, working lands, ridge lines, steep slopes, riparian buffers, and flood plains. HAP is working toward achieving the following program goals: 

-Highlighting, protecting, and conserving special places that have ecological and cultural importance;

-Highlighting important connections between these special places;

-Revitalizing damaged ecosystems especially in key ecological corridors;

-Empowering citizens and communities to strengthen the linkages among cultural heritage, economic viability and the condition of the environment;

-Enhancing opportunities for the restoration industry in the Highlands, which will enhance lasting employment opportunities for its residents; and

-Leveraging existing resources to support all these goals.

In addition to the assistance mentioned above, SRF may now provide assistance for:(1) the construction, repair, or replacement of decentralized wastewater treatment systems that treat municipal wastewater or domestic sewage; (2) measures to manage, reduce, treat or recapture stormwater or subsurface drainage water; (3) any municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency for measures to reduce the demand for publicly owned treatment works capacity through water conservation, efficiency or reuse; (4) the development and implementation of watershed projects meeting the criteria set forth in section 122; (5) any municipality or interrmunicipal, interstate, or State agency for measures to reduce the energy consumption needs for publicly owned treatment works; (6) reusing or recycling wastewater, stormwater, or subsurface drainage water; (7) measures to increase the security of publicly owned treatment works; and (8) any qualified nonprofit entity, as determined by the Administrator, to provide assistance to owners and operators of small and medium publicly owned treatment works. The capitalization grant is deposited in the State's SRF, which is used to provide loans and other types of financial assistance, to local communities and intermunicipal and interstate agencies. 4 percent of the grant amounts, $400,000 each year or 1/5 percent per year of the current valuation (net profit) of the fund may be used by the States for the cost of administering the SRF. States determine priorities for funding within their State in accordance with the CWA. A portion of the funding must be used to provide additional subsidy in the form of grants, principal forgiveness or negative interest loans. The maximum percentage that may be provided as additional subsidy will range from 0 percent to 30 percent based on the amount of the total appropriation. For example, if the total appropriation is less than or equal to $1 billion, no additional subsidy would be authorized; if the total appropriation is greater than or equal to $1.3 billion, additional subsidy up to 30 percent of the grant would be authorized; but, if the total appropriation is greater than $1 billion but less than $1.3 billion, a percentage equal to the percentage by which the appropriation exceeds $1 billion would be authorized. Additional subsidy may only be provided to a municipality or intermunicipal, interstate, or State agency and used to benefit a municipality who meets the SRF affordability criteria, benefits individual ratepayers in residential user rate class or to implement a process, material, technique, or technology to address water efficiency goals, energy efficiency goals, mitigate stormwater runoff or encourage sustainable project planning, design and construction. The program supports the Agency's strategic goal of providing clean and safe water. The Disaster Relief Act, 2019, (Public Law 116-20), provides additional funding for states and water systems impacted by the Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Yutu, and the 2018 wildfires and earthquakes. These disasters affected drinking water and wastewater in EPA regions 4, 9, and 10. Based on the information EPA has, only California had wildfires with major disaster declarations for public assistance during calendar year 2018 and only Alaska had an earthquake with major disaster declaration for public assistance.

The goals for REMAP are to transfer EMAP's latest scientific techniques for ecological monitoring to EPA Regions, States, Tribes and local decision makers. ORD works with the EPA Regional Offices to support projects meeting EMAP criteria and that are of importance to needs within the Regions. EMAP support for these projects includes: contributing to development of the scientific design of projects; assistance with the selection and evaluation of appropriate indicators and methods for measurement; application of information management approaches; analysis and interpretation of data; and providing a source of funding. EPA funds projects in each of its 10 Regions. Projects are normally funded for up to 2 years, but longer projects are occasionally supported. Annual announcements reflect priority needs in those Regions where funding will be allocated for new projects. The primary objectives of the solicited research are to provide States and Tribes with methods and approaches for incorporating statistically valid ecological monitoring data into their environmental decision-making process. Project goals are to be consistent with EMAP's probabilistic approach (www.epa.gov/emap) to answer questions about ecological conditions at regional and local levels. Information produced from projects is to be transferable to Regional, State and Tribal water quality monitoring programs and regulatory agencies. Research proposals must address one or more of the following monitoring needs for state and tribal aquatic (headwater streams, lakes, near shore coastal areas, wetlands, wadeable streams or large rivers) resources: 
-State and Tribal monitoring needs for water quality reporting (CWA Section 305b). 
-Information needed for identifying impaired waters (CWA Section 303d). 
-Using probability information to identify the effectiveness of restoration/remediation efforts. 
-Advancing the science of biological reference condition for establishing biocriteria.

Molybdenum-99 Program,"Technology for Demonstration and Commercial Scale Production of a Reliable, Domestic Supply of Molybdenum-99 without the Use of Highly Enriched Uranium","NNSA, ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) Office of Material Management and Minimization (NA-23) is leading the effort to demonstrate and achieve commercial-scale production of the medical isotope, Molybdenum-99, hereafter referred to as Mo-99, without the use of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the United States.  

Mo-99 is a critical radioisotope whose decay byproduct technetium-99m (Tc-99m), is used in approximately 40,000 nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures performed daily in the United States. Its primary uses include diagnosing heart disease, treating cancer, and studying organ structure and function. The isotope’s short half-life and excellent binding properties make it uniquely suited for medical procedures.  However, due to its short half-life it must be produced continuously to meet the medical community’s requirements.  The United States does not currently have a domestic production capability for Mo-99 sufficient to meet the needs of the U.S. healthcare community, currently estimated at 4,500 6-day curies per week.  Until any U.S. producer enters the market, the United States must import all of its supply from foreign producers, which in some instances use proliferation-sensitive HEU in its production processes. The establishment of reliable, commercial, non-HEU-based Mo-99 production in the United States complements the long-standing U.S. policy to minimize and eliminate the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications in order to prevent the potential theft of this material for malevolent use.  

The United States is at the nexus of two related priorities: the need to ensure a reliable, robust Mo-99 supply for U.S. patient care, and discouraging the use of proliferation-sensitive HEU in civilian applications.  NNSA will issue Cooperative Agreements with the purpose of providing additional federal funding to accelerate commercial Mo-99 projects’ time to market so that industry and government can fulfill these two critical priorities and decrease the U.S. medical community’s reliance on foreign supplies of Mo-99."

Environmental Management R&D and Validation Testing on High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) Filters ,Environmental Management R&D,"ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF, ENERGY, DEPARTMENT OF","EM research and development and validation testing (R&DT) provides necessary investments in mid- to long-range activities to address the technological gaps in defense environmental cleanup, including: (1) radioactive liquid and solid waste treatment, storage and disposal; (2) soil and groundwater remediation; (3) nuclear materials and spent fuel management and disposition; (4) facility deactivation and decommissioning; and (5) public, worker, facility/asset, and environmental safety and security. EM R&DT investments seek high-payoff, game-changing technologies and innovations to positively impact EM’s program lifecycle baseline by: (1) reducing costs; (2) accelerating schedules; (3) mitigating mission uncertainties, vulnerabilities, and risks; and (4) minimizing the mortgage associated with long-term, post-closure and post-completion stewardship. EM R&DT also provides the opportunity to perform work and operate facilities more effectively and in a manner that assures public, worker and environmental safely.  New and novel technologies as well as innovative solutions are needed to address the significant challenges associated with the remaining nuclear cleanup work that will span the next five decades.  The program encompasses the entire maturation lifecycle of technology which includes transfer of technologies from other nuclear and non-nuclear industry sectors.

EM’s technology portfolio will leverage and harness the expertise, resources, and capabilities of US universities and colleges.  Academia will support EM in four distinct roles: (1) as an expert-based resource for conducting early-stage and applied scientific research and for providing engineering solutions; (2) as a pool of recognized subject matter experts to support technical peer reviews and independent technical assessments; (3) as incubators and pipelines for EM’s future workforce; and (4) as a source of independent testing, verification, and confirmatory evaluation. EM will work to improve the technical training of its workforce through Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education, experiential learning, and apprenticeships.

EM R&DT supports the safety and quality of permanent containment and confinement ventilation systems as well as modular worksite and breathing-zone ventilation systems used to support nuclear, radiological, chemical, and other high-consequence facility and environmental operations. Future funds will be executed to: (1) conduct basic and early-stage applied research, particularly in areas that lead to the basis of the development, transfer and industrial utilization (commercialization) of new clean air technologies; (2) perform design-specification and quality control inspection, testing and evaluation of existing, newly available, and emerging designs of High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters and other air filtration technologies; (3) perform testing and evaluation of HEPA filter performance in design-basis and off-normal operating conditions as well as in scenarios of major plant or system failures; (4) perform computer modeling and computational (numerical) simulation of airflow dynamics, including multiphase flow, particle tracking, evaporation, combustion, convection, conduction, and radiation heat transfer; (5) perform in-depth engineering analysis of complex fluid flows, including detailed flow characteristics such as velocity, pressure, turbulence, temperature, and species concentration for internal or external flows; (6) support the research and development of new and plant-specific designs of air filtration technologies, including in-line sensors and measurement devices; and (7) complementary and alternative technologies, such as robotics and remote systems, to support the inspection and maintenance of ventilation systems as critical infrastructure. As air filtration systems perform critical safety functions in many high-consequence facilities, continued focus on the quality of commercial, off-the-self technologies as well as on the advancing state-of-the-art must be maintained to assure safety and quality in environmental management operations.

Specific to HEPA filters, R&DT under various normal and upset test conditions will help determine valuable operational information (i.e., develop suggested controls and operational methods, and identify failure modes) that can be applied at various commercial and Government/military facilities that treat, store, or process nuclear material or waste streams (e.g. commercial nuclear power facilities), or filter out hazardous particulates or dust for commercial microelectronic clean rooms or hospital operations. This R&DT may increase the protective nature of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) AG-1 Code (Code on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment), enhance the ability of professionals to design filters and air filtration systems, and reduce uncertainty in the development of standard operating procedures for facilities involved in nuclear containment ventilation activities.

Research and Training in Complementary and Integrative Health,National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health,"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","To evaluate  complementary and integrative health approaches.  The following objectives support this goal:  (1) coordinate and facilitate the investigation of complementary and integrative health approaches through peer-reviewed grant solicitations; (2) interface with the NCCIH National Advisory Council; (3) conduct technology assessment conferences for the purpose of establishing areas of Clinical and Pre-clinical research that need to be further developed within complementary health approaches; and (4) maintain a comprehensive bibliographic data base in conjunction with the National Library of Medicine.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) regularly examines and redefines its research priorities. In setting research priorities, NCCIH considers its existing research portfolio, its 5-year strategic plan, the recommendations of the National Advisory Council for Complementary and Integrative Health, current scientific advances, the plans of other NIH institutes and centers, and input from expert panels and stakeholders. Research constituting a rigorous evidence base for complementary health approaches will be developed through a range of research strategies including basic and translational research, and clinical investigation. Priority setting also takes into account: 1)scientific promise, 2)amenability to rigorous scientific inquiry,3) potential to change health practices, and 4) relationship to use and practice.

Research Approaches
Basic, translational, efficacy and effectiveness research for
Complementary and Integrative Health approaches need to be studied across the continuum of basic, translational, efficacy, and effectiveness research.  NCCIH continues to emphasize basic research that defines biological effects and mechanisms of action; NCCIH's basic research is aimed at understanding the nature of complementary health approaches such as their biology, physiology, and physical, chemical and behavioral properties. NCCIH also supports the development of tools, models, and methodologies for studying these approaches. NCCIH  continues to encourage efficacy studies to determine specific clinical effects of complementary health approaches  under carefully controlled conditions that minimize nonspecific and contextual effects. There is also the need to strengthen translational and preliminary clinical research required to design and implement definitive clinical research and ""real world"" outcomes and effectiveness research that capitalizes on the reality that many complementary health approaches  are in widespread public use.
NCCIH’s support of translational research addresses the need for valid, reliable and relevant research tools, outcome measures, and innovative methodology to enhance the rigor of complementary health approaches within clinical studies and to ensure that they are maximally informative. NCCIH emphasizes studies that inform the design of future trials such as those that will: develop and validate outcome measures; standardize treatment protocols or algorithms;  validate treatment algorithms and/or; develop measures of quality control or treatment fidelity; assess effects of various doses or intervention durations; develop preliminary clinical evidence regarding efficacy and safety to support estimates of sample size; or establish feasibility of interventions or study designs in specific populations for future studies.
NCCIH's clinical research portfolio utilizes clinical trial, case-control, observational, cohort, qualitative, and other experimental methodologies to determine safety and estimate the efficacy of complementary health approaches . The clinical research portfolio  includes effectiveness studies of the contribution to improved health and wellness made by complementary health approaches  as they are practiced in ""real-world"" settings.
In general phase III clinical trials will be supported under the cooperative agreement mechanism after careful consideration by NCCIH Staff. Investigators interested in proposing phase III studies are strongly encouraged to contact a relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers)
Areas of Special Interest
Fundamental scientific inquiry is essential to the progress of biomedicine by enhancing the understanding of how living systems work. This understanding serves as a foundation for translational and clinical studies that can lead to improved approaches to the management, treatment, and prevention of diseases and symptoms. One key goal is to advance our understanding of basic biological mechanisms of action of natural products including prebiotics and probiotics. NCCIH will continue to sponsor research on compounds isolated from natural products as well as complex mixtures from which they originate. Additionally, NCCIH will continue to support research to elucidate the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on the microbiota naturally present in the human body. Another key goal is to advance our understanding of the mechanisms through which mind and body approaches such as meditation, spinal manipulation, massage, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis and acupuncture affect health, resiliency, and well-being.   A third key goal is to develop new and improved research methods and tools for conducting rigorous studies of complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. These new methods could catalyze advances in natural product methodology and support development of novel technology and instruments to carry out rigorous research on symptom management and functional changes primarily for mind and body approaches. To improve care for hard -to-manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression, both mind and body practices and natural products will be rigorously studied using well-established methodology. NCCIH will also support studies in ""real world"" clinical settings to test the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches, including their integration into health care. Individual behavior plays a key role in health promotion and disease prevention. It is well established that adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors (diet and exercise) and modifying unhealthy behaviors reduces risks of major chronic diseases. NCCIH will investigate mechanisms of action of complementary and integrative health approaches in health resilience and practices that improve health and prevent disease. These approaches will be studied across the lifespan and in diverse populations. NCCIH will also explore research opportunities to study and access the safety and efficacy of complementary health approaches in nonclinical settings such as community- and employer-based wellness programs.  

Top Scientific Priorities
The top scientific priorities include the nonpharmacologic management of pain,  neurobiological effects and mechanisms, innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products, disease prevention and health promotion across the lifespan, and clinical trials utilizing innovative study designs to access complementary health approaches and their integration into health care. Pain is the condition for which adults in the United States most often use complementary and integrative health approaches. Growing evidence indicates that some complementary health approaches may help in its treatment and management. Discovering the mechanisms by which a complementary approach exerts its effects could help in the design of better treatments and predict which people are most likely to respond. Whether and how complementary health approaches directly modulate or modify the structure and/or the function of the entire or part of the nervous system remains understudied. Advances in genomics, neuroscience, stem cells, systems biology, and neuroimaging offer excellent conceptual resources and opportunities for innovative and impactful mechanistic studies of complementary health approaches. The purpose of innovative approaches for establishing biological signatures of natural products is to advance the characterization of the biologic activity of complex natural products broadly with an emphasis on determining metabolic profiles. There has been a growing interest in the use of complementary health approaches for the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders  and for the promotion of psychological and physical health, well-being, and resilience. However, the evidence for the use of complementary modalities in the context of prevention and health promotion is modest. Rigorously designed, developmentally appropriate studies are needed to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary health approaches for health promotion and disease prevention across the lifespan.

Early Stage and New Investigators
NCCIH is strongly committed to assisting new and early stage investigators in establishing a research career. Early stage investigators are those within 10 years of completing their terminal research degree, or their medical residency, or its equivalent. New investigators are those who have yet to compete successfully for a substantial (e.g., R01) NIH research grant. Each Advisory Council round, based on available funds, NCCIH: 1) will consider early stage or new investigator status as one of the criteria for designating grant applications as being of high program priority and 2) may make additional R01 grant awards to new and early stage investigators with percentiles or scores out of  payline order.

NCCIH continues to accept applications in areas not listed as a specific priority area via the investigator initiated funding opportunities. All investigators are urged to discuss potential applications with the relevant NCCIH Program Officer (https://nccih.nih.gov/tools/emailprogramofficers)"

Mental Health Research Grants,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The mission of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.  In fiscal year (FY) 2008, NIMH released its first Strategic Plan, which guided the Institute’s work toward this mission.  
In March 2015, NIMH released its new Strategic Plan for Research.  Moving forward, the NIMH will be guided by both this new Plan and by the Strategic Research Priorities based on the Plan.  

The Strategic Plan for Research comprises four high-level Strategic Objectives: (1) Define the mechanisms of complex behaviors; (2) Chart mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene; (3) Strive for prevention and cure; and (4) Strengthen the public health impact of NIMH-supported research.  The four Objectives of the Plan describe the continuum of mental health research, ranging from understanding basic pathophysiology, to defining the trajectories of mental illnesses, to developing innovative treatment and prevention strategies, to ensuring public health impact.  The Institute’s overall funding strategy is to support a broad spectrum of investigator-initiated research in fundamental science, with increasing use of Institute-solicited initiatives for applied research where public health impact is a short-term measure of success.  

Cross-cutting themes relevant to all research supported by NIMH include the Research Domain Criteria Initiative; the Institute’s new experimental medicine approach, which focuses on studies with defined targets and milestones; the role of the environment in the pathogenesis of mental illnesses; the new culture of open science with broad and rapid data sharing; preemptive medicine; research designed to reduce and eliminate mental health disparities both within and outside the United States – specifically, research on sex, gender, age, racial, and ethnic differences related to mental illnesses; partnerships with external stakeholders; and, supporting and training future generations of mental health researchers. 

Specific program objectives include:

To determine the molecular, cellular, and systems components underlying brain connectivity and dynamic patterns of brain activity using model systems, and human studies; to identify the mechanisms responsible for establishing and maintaining circuits; to identify and validate novel assays to quantify changes in the activity of molecules, cells, and circuits; and, to elucidate the basic biology linking changes in molecular-, cellular-, and circuit-based targets to alterations in complex behaviors.

To define genomic variations associated with mental illnesses and determine the biological consequences of these variations; to define the molecular mechanisms that determine how experience has enduring effects on gene expression, brain function, and behavior; to delineate environmental and biological factors altering genomic risk for mental illnesses; and, to develop analytical tools for multi-scale data integration.

To identify cells and brain networks that contribute to various aspects of mental function and dysfunction, such as cognition, emotion, and social behavior; to determine how changes in the physiological properties of molecules, cells, and circuits contribute to mental illnesses; to develop biomarkers of impaired neural function in humans at the level of molecules, cells, and circuits; and, to develop innovative technologies, as well as new pharmacological and genetic tools, to interrogate and modulate the signaling pathways and circuits altered by mental illnesses.

To characterize developmental processes across biological and behavioral domains of analysis that give rise to mental illnesses throughout the lifespan; to identify sensitive periods for typical and atypical mental health trajectories; and, to determine modifiers of maturational and illness trajectories, emphasizing periods of sensitivity to perturbation and/or potential for intervention.

This pilot implements real-time, on-line data exchange for states to share records and other information to support permanent placements of foster care children in homes across state lines.  The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) ensures safe and suitable interstate placements for children in foster case.  In many cases, permanent placement with relative or adoptive families in other states is in the best interests of the child.  But to make these interstate placements - - after doing the required due diligence to ensure that the placement is appropriate for the child – states currently share and exchange case files, information and evaluations, and to collect, track, synthesize and report comprehensive data through paper-based processes.  The pilot will test whether an automated system reduces the time to process such cross-state exchanges to determine whether a placement is safe and suitable.  The pilot evaluation will measure timeliness of communication, expeditious exchange of case documentation and similar immediate outcomes as well as the utilization and adherence to streamlined ICPC processes.

Congress authorized AI/ANs to have access to Medicare and Medicaid services when provided through Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities located in tribal communities and amended titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to permit IHS facilities to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services provided to eligible AI/ANs. This authority was later extended to tribal facilities.  Congress has also provided authority for Indian health care programs and beneficiaries to participate in the Children’s Health Insurance program and the Health Insurance Marketplace.  
These changes have created a direct relationship between CMS and the Indian Health Service, The research conducted under this cooperative agreement is needed to help improve administration of CMS’ programs given that CMS and IHS programs operate under different and sometimes competing authorities for CMS’ programs, the Social Security Act and for IHS’ programs, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and the Indian Self Determination Education and Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638. To make CMS’ programs work with Indian health program authorities, a crucial first is step is for CMS to understand the impact of its policies on Indian health care providers and tribal members so that the agency can provide the AI/AN community greater access to CMS’ programs  in an effective and efficient manner.  

The authority at Section 1110 of the Social Security Act permits CMS to enter into grants andcooperative arrangements with organizations and certain other entities in order to aid in improving administration and effectiveness of programs administered by the agency. To this end, the work conducted under this cooperative agreement will address the potential and actual impacts of CMS’ programs on AI/ANs and the health care system serving these beneficiaries. CMS’ understanding of the impact of its policies is vital to improving greater AI/AN access to and participation in CMS’ programs; improving and ensuring that appropriate health care payments and resources are provided to IHS  tribal, and urban Indian Health program providers; and contributing to overall improved health outcomes for Indian people.  The information and activities produced  or provided under the cooperative agreement will be used to develop culturally appropriate activities and strategies to improve how CMS’ program operate and are administered in Indian country.

Nursing Research,,"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) is to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities. To achieve this mission, NINR supports and conducts clinical and basic research and research training on health and illness, research that spans and integrates the behavioral and biological sciences, and that develops the scientific basis for clinical practice. From premature infants in neonatal intensive care units, to adolescents living with diabetes, to elderly cancer survivors coping with pain, nursing research develops the science to help people strengthen the quality of their lives.  Nursing science transcends the boundaries of disease and research disciplines to better understand the experiences of individuals and families living with illness and to develop personalized approaches that maximize health and well-being for individuals at all stages of life, across diverse populations and settings. NINR’s scientific programs are organized around four major focus areas: symptom science, wellness, self-management of chronic conditions, and the science of end-of-life and palliative care. The Institute also explores ways in which new innovations and technologies can contribute to advancing nursing science across these four areas. In addition, NINR has a longstanding and continuing commitment to developing the next generation of nurse scientists: those individuals and team members who will carry the field of nursing science into the future. NINR’s research program in symptom science seeks a better understanding of the biological and behavioral aspects of symptoms, with the goal of developing and testing new interventions to reduce the disabling effects of symptoms and improving patient health outcomes and quality of life. Research efforts in wellness investigate the key biological, behavioral, and social factors that promote long-term health and healthy behaviors and prevent the development of illness across health conditions, settings, and the lifespan. Research in wellness is also focused on developing and testing culturally appropriate interventions to promote health and prevent illness in minority and underserved groups. NINR research in self-management seeks to engage individuals and families as active participants in maintaining and improving quality of life while living with a chronic condition or multiple chronic conditions. Self-management research encompasses health strategies that allow an individual and their health care provider to adapt treatments to individual circumstances. As the lead NIH Institute for end-of-life research, NINR supports science to assist individuals, families, and health care professionals in managing the symptoms of advanced, serious illness, and planning for end-of-life decisions. NINR also recognizes that high-quality, evidence-based palliative care is a critical component of maintaining quality of life at any stage of illness, not limited to the end of life. In focusing on innovation and technology, NINR promotes technological advancements that address a range of health care challenges and facilitate the delivery of real-time personalized information to individuals and families, health care providers, and communities. In order to prepare an innovative, diverse, and talented next generation of nurse scientists, NINR supports a variety of training opportunities for scientists and trainees at all career levels, particularly those at an early career stage who are so critical to sustaining the future of innovative research and high quality health care. NINR supports individual and institutional pre- and postdoctoral research fellowships, as well as career development awards, and sponsors numerous ‘research intensives’ for nurse scientists at all career levels. NINR’s Division of Intramural Research conducts basic and clinical research on the interactions among molecular mechanisms underlying symptoms and environmental influences on individual health outcomes. The program focuses on the biological and behavioral underpinnings of symptoms of chronic conditions, including digestive disorders, cancer-related fatigue, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorders, as well as clinical interventions to alleviate symptoms."

Flexible Alternatives for State Transformation Model,FAST,"CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The Flexible Alternatives for State Transformation (FAST) Model will provide states with an opportunity to develop and implement payment reforms that are driven by state needs and enable local innovation to improve healthcare value and the health of populations. Through FAST, the Innovation Center will empower states to create transformative multi-payer models in which participating payers are aligned in how they incentivize healthcare value, quality, and outcomes.Together in partnership, states and CMS will support providers in their ongoing transformation to a value-based payment system. Awardee states will have the flexibility to determine, based on state and community needs, the specific parameters of the proposed model, including the incentive structure and population and/or geographic region included in the model. 
FAST provides states with the flexibility to pursue comprehensive and sustainable payment reform through one of two tracks that best meets their needs:
A.	Transformation Track Support states to launch a new multi-payer model with Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payer participation. These models will meet the criteria outlined in the Innovation Center's 2017 Guidance for Medicare Participation in a state-based multi-payer model, as well as criteria to become an Advanced Alternative Payment Model . States may request that CMS waive certain Medicare rules (e.g., the state sets ACO benchmarks for Medicare, the state has authority to set global budgets for hospitals) using 1115A Waiver Authority as part of the model. Full implementation of models proposed under the Transformation Track would occur after the initial 2-year SLIM award, contingent upon successful negotiation of a signed agreement between CMS and the state, and OMB approval. Receipt of a FAST award in no way guarantees approval of the proposed state-designed multi-payer model. 
B.	Alignment Track A:  Support states that are interested in either modifying existing Medicaid and/or commercial payment and delivery innovations to qualify as Other Payer Advanced APMs ; or increasing Medicare provider participation in existing Advanced APMs, particularly to build on local innovations at the practice level, and to increase small and rural and specialty provider opportunities to participate in Advanced APMs. Implementation of the proposed state-designed multi-payer model would occur after the initial 2-year FAST award, and may require CMS approval (e.g., for a Medicaid State Plan Amendment or waiver). Alignment Track states may not propose an 1115A Medicare Waiver as part of the application to the Alignment Track A.
C.	Alignment Track B: Support states to expand existing, or launch new, commercial and/or Medicaid alternative payment models, with an ultimate goal of building state and provider capacity to eventually participate in Advanced APMs. Implementation of the proposed state-designed model would occur after the initial 2-year FAST award, and may require CMS approval (e.g., for a Medicaid State Plan Amendment or waiver). Alignment Track B states may not propose an 1115A Medicare Waiver as part of the application to the Alignment Track B.

Networking2Save”:  CDC’s National Network Approach to Preventing and Controlling Tobacco-related Cancers in Special Populations,Networking2Save,"CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The Office on Smoking and Health and Division of Cancer Prevention and Control seek to build on the progress of the previously funded networks and expand work to address tobacco-and cancer- related health disparities among populations particularly vulnerable to tobacco industry marketing tactics and with higher cancer incidence and death rates. To accelerate the decline in cigarette smoking, address other tobacco use, and reduce the burden of cancer disease and death among the entire population, it will be critical to continue to focus prevention and control efforts on those populations that are most vulnerable and harder to reach with general population interventions. The complex interaction of multiple factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, cultural characteristics, acculturation, inequitable policy implementation and enforcement, stress) and persistent and targeted tobacco industry marketing to these vulnerable populations, contribute to tobacco related disparities. Many factors also contribute to cancer-related disparities such as socioeconomic status, cultural characteristics, diet, and access to healthcare services. 

Continued efforts to address the unique need for population-specific capacity and infrastructure to support tobacco and cancer control strategies and promote access to tobacco cessation services, cancer prevention, and treatment and survivor resources for populations experiencing disparities are justified. This tailored strategy is designed to achieve the benefits of an overall population-based policy approach to commercial tobacco and cancer control.         "

This grant initiative seeks to assist States in helping low-income and disadvantaged children enter Kindergarten prepared and ready to succeed in school and to help improve the transitions from the early care and education setting to elementary school. The overall responsibility of the ESSA PDG is to assist States in the coordination of their existing early childhood service delivery models and funding streams - for the purpose of serving more children birth through age five in a mixed delivery model. The ESSA PDG has three targeted purposes. It aims to:  

""(1) assist States to develop, update, or implement a strategic plan that facilitates collaboration and coordination among existing programs of early childhood care and education in a mixed delivery system across the State designed to prepare low-income and disadvantaged children to enter kindergarten and to improve transitions from such system into the local educational agency or elementary school that enrolls such children, by—
(A) more efficiently using existing Federal, State, local, and non-governmental resources to align and strengthen the delivery of existing programs, 
(B) coordinating the delivery models and funding streams existing in the State's mixed delivery system; and 
(C) developing recommendations to better use existing resources in order to improve-- 
(i) the overall participation of children in a mixed delivery system of Federal, State, and local early childhood education programs;
(ii) program quality while maintaining availability of services;
(iii) parental choice among existing programs; and 
(iv) school readiness for children from low- income and disadvantaged families, including during such children's transition into elementary school;

(2) encourage partnerships among Head Start providers, State and local governments, Indian tribes and tribal organizations, private entities (including faith- and community- based entities), and local educational agencies, to improve coordination, program quality, and delivery of services; and

(3) maximize parental choice among a mixed delivery system of early childhood education program providers."" [Note to 42 USC 9831(a)]

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in consultation with the Department of Education (ED) will be soliciting applications from eligible States to carry out the activities of the ESSA PDG.

The new ESSA PDG program seeks to empower State governments to lead the way in leveraging Federal, State and local early care and education investments. States are not to create another early childhood program, but rather help coordinate early childhood programs and services that already exist in the State according to the identified needs of the State.

The ESSA PDG is a competitive grant authorized for up to four years - a 1 year initial grant and a renewal grant of up to 3 years. Annual funding for the program is contingent upon annual Congressional appropriation.

The Initial Grant requires the States to develop, update, and implement a comprehensive, Statewide, birth through five needs assessment and related strategic plan. The Renewal Grant allows States to continue activities begun with the Initial Grant and/or to carry out additional activities including the awarding of subgrants to improve the State's Early childhood care and learning mixed delivery systems and services."

Implementation of a new, reliable, valid, clinically credible and potentially automatable VAP surveillance definition will provide the foundation for national surveillance and prevention efforts and for pay-for-reporting and pay-for-performance programs, leading to improved patient safety and fewer complications for patients needing mechanical ventilation. Specifically, the objectives of this project are to:  1. Implement prospective sVAP surveillance in 9 acute-care hospitals currently conducting VAP surveillance using existing National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions; 2. Compare the total sVAP surveillance burden to the total burden associated with use of existing NHSN VAP definitions;, and 3. Implement an evidence-based VAP prevention initiative and evaluate sVAP preventability by assessing the association between sVAP rates and prevention measure compliance rates. Nine hospitals currently engaged in NHSN VAP surveillance will be recruited.

Health Care Innovation Awards (HCIA),,"CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The first round of the Health Innovation Awards (HCIA), announced on November 14, 2011, was a broad solicitation in which CMS welcomed a wide variety of proposals.  In HCIA, Round One, CMS funded 107 Awardees who proposed compelling new models of service delivery/ payment improvements that showed substantial promise of delivering the Three-Part Aim of better health, better health care, and lower costs through improved quality for Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beneficiaries. Successful models included plans to rapidly develop and/or deploy the requisite workforce to support the proposed model. Awards recognized interventions that showed capability to improve care within the first 6 months of the award, while creating a sustainable pathway to net Medicare/Medicaid/CHIP savings within two to three years.  These models of service delivery and payment improvement are now entering Year Two of the three-year period of performance for Round One of the HCIA.
A second round of the Health Care Innovation Awards (HCIA) was announced on May 15, 2013.  In HCIA Round Two, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will fund applicants who propose new service delivery models and design corresponding new payment models that show promise of providing better health, better health care, and lower costs through improved quality for Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) enrollees.
In Round Two, CMS is specifically seeking new payment and service delivery models in four broad Innovation Categories, as follows: 
•	Models that are designed to rapidly reduce Medicare, Medicaid, and/or CHIP costs in outpatient and/or post-acute settings.  Priority areas are diagnostic services, outpatient radiology, high-cost physician-administered drugs, home based services, therapeutic services, and post-acute services. While preference will be given to submissions within these priority areas, CMS will consider submissions in other outpatient and/or post-acute areas within this Category.
•	Models that improve care for populations with specialized needs.  Priority areas are high-cost pediatric populations, children in foster care, children at high risk for dental disease, adolescents in crisis, persons with Alzheimer’s disease, persons living with HIV/AIDS (in particular, efforts to link and retain patients in care and improve medication adherence that lead to viral suppression), persons requiring long-term support and services, and persons with serious behavioral health needs.  While preference will be given to submissions within these areas, CMS will consider submissions that improve care for other populations with specialized needs.
•	Models that test approaches for specific types of providers to transform their financial and clinical models.  Priority areas are models designed for physician specialties and subspecialties (for example, oncology and cardiology), and for pediatric providers who provide services to children with complex medical issues (including but not limited to care for children with multiple medical conditions, behavioral health issues, congenital disease, chronic respiratory disease, and complex social issues); and that include, as appropriate, shared decision-making mechanisms to engage beneficiaries and their families and/or caregivers in treatment choices.  While preference will be given to submissions within these areas, CMS will consider submissions in other areas within this Category and from other specific types of non-physician providers.
•	Models that improve the health of populations – defined geographically (health of a community), clinically (health of those with specific diseases), or by socioeconomic class – through activities focused on engaging beneficiaries, prevention (for example, a diabetes prevention program or a hypertension prevention program), wellness, and comprehensive care that extend beyond the clinical service delivery setting.  These models may include community based organizations or coalitions and may leverage community health improvement efforts.  These models must have a direct link to improving the quality and reducing the costs of care for Medicare, Medicaid, and/or CHIP beneficiaries. Priority areas are: models that lead to better prevention and control of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and HIV/AIDS; models that promote behaviors that reduce risk for chronic disease, including increased physical activity and improved nutrition; models that promote medication adherence and self-management skills; models that prevent falls among older adults; and broader models that link clinical care with community-based interventions.  While preference will be given to submissions within these areas, CMS will consider submissions in other areas within this Category.
These categories were identified as gaps in the current Innovation Center portfolio and as areas that could result in potentially usable models for changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment methods.  This round of Innovation Awards encourages a strong focus on Medicaid and CHIP populations.  In addition, models that primarily focus on acute hospital inpatient care are excluded from this round and will not be reviewed. (Hospitals are eligible to apply for awards if they propose a model within one of the four Innovation Categories described below.)
In Round Two – in contrast to the first round – CMS specifically seeks new payment models to support the service delivery models funded by this initiative.
Awardees will be required to implement the service delivery models at the start of the three-year cooperative agreement period and submit a fully developed new Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP payment model by the end of the cooperative agreement period.  Successful applicants will demonstrate that they can implement a model that improves quality of care and reduces cost within the first six months of the award and delivers net savings to CMS within three years.  At its discretion and consistent with the requirements of Section 1115A of the Social Security Act, CMS may further develop one or more of these payment and service delivery models and open them to participation through a subsequent solicitation.

The final authority on all matters, including but not limited to application procedures, format of proposals, deadlines, criteria, eligibility, model test requirements, and the nature of the Funding Opportunity, is the appropriate Funding Opportunity Announcement itself, either for Round One or Round Two of the Health Care Innovation Awards.

In April 2011, the Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office awarded design contracts to 15 states to implement State Demonstrations to Integrate Care for Medicare-Medicaid Individuals.  Subsequently, CMS released a letter to State Medicaid Directors which discussed two models for integrating care and aligning financial incentives for Medicare and Medicaid as part of CMS’ Financial Alignment Initiative, a joint initiative of the Innovation Center and the Medicare Medicaid Coordination Office, under which States and CMS will collaborate to integrate care and financing for Medicare-Medicaid individuals. The Financial Alignment Initiative is a unique Federal-state partnership to test aligning the service delivery and financing of the Medicare and Medicaid programs to better serve Medicare-Medicaid individuals. As part of this effort, there is a need for strong beneficiary support education and outreach in each State that is implementing a Financial Alignment model, including options counseling for beneficiaries. 

Awardees will develop and implement a coordinated SHIP/ADRC strategy and action plan to provide beneficiaries who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid – during both the Phase 1 Activities and Ongoing Activities of the program, as described in the funding opportunity announcement - with objective information and one-on-one counseling on the nature of the state’s Financial Alignment model.  Such activities will include, but are not limited to, providing information and counseling as to how and when the project will be implemented, the options these dual eligible beneficiaries will have for receiving their Medicare and Medicaid services in their state, the appeal rights they will have under the model, and what they need to do to participate in the program. The SHIP/ADRC staff assigned to this project must be able to provide this information and counseling in a way that is easy for beneficiaries to understand and is culturally and linguistically appropriate. These activities must be carried out in a SHIP/ADRC.  Also, the SHIP/ADRC should possess a basic understanding of all CMS approved State Financial Alignment Initiatives.

Accountable Health Communities ,AHC ,"CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (the Innovation Center), will assess whether systematically identifying the health-related social needs of community- dwelling Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, including those who are dually eligible, and addressing their identified needs impacts those beneficiaries’ total health care costs and their inpatient and outpatient utilization. Section 3021 of the ACA authorizes the Innovation Center to design, implement and evaluate innovative payment and service delivery models to improve quality and reduce costs. Rigorous evaluation requirements of the model’s impact influence model design parameters.

The Accountable Health Communities (AHC) Model is based on emerging evidence that addressing health-related social needs through enhanced clinical-community linkages can improve health outcomes and reduce costs. This model will support community collaboration to systematically: (1) screen beneficiaries to identify unmet health- related social needs; (2) refer beneficiaries to increase awareness of community services; (3) provide person- centered navigation services to assist beneficiaries with accessing community services; and (4) align clinical and community services to ensure that community services are available and responsive to the needs of beneficiaries. The expectation is that these efforts will lead to a reduction in health care utilization and costs.
The funding opportunity announcement (FOA) offered three interventions of varying intensity (each referred to as a “track”) to better link beneficiaries to community services: the Assistance Track Intervention, the Alignment Track Intervention or a third opportunity called the Awareness Track. The Awareness Track opportunity has subsequently been withdrawn.
The Assistance Track Intervention will test whether assisting beneficiaries with accessing services through community service navigation impacts total health care cost and inpatient and outpatient health care utilization. This intervention offers universal screening of health-related social needs, use of a community resource inventory to connect beneficiaries to available community services, identification of high-risk beneficiaries as part of a smarter spending strategy to target additional resources where they are needed the most, and community service navigation to assist high risk beneficiaries with resolving health-related social needs. The Alignment Track Intervention builds on the intervention of the Assistance Track and tests whether a combination of navigation services at the individual beneficiary level and partner alignment at the community level impacts ED visits and inpatient hospital admissions. This approach recognizes that there are significant barriers to effective integration of the health care delivery systems, governmental public health systems, and the community-based service system due to different cultures, funding streams and data systems. Effective and responsive infrastructures are needed to ensure that community services are available and address the health-related social needs of beneficiaries. This intervention incorporates innovations included in the Assistance Track and adds structural and financial support designed to foster community-wide realignment of resources to more effectively address beneficiaries’ health-related social needs.

Successful applicants were selected to participate in a single track for a 5-year period. Although tracks share common design elements, each track’s intervention pathway and underlying hypothesis is distinct.

This program addresses the “Healthy People 2020” focus area of tobacco use and the goal of reducing illness, disability, and death related to tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure. Preventing tobacco use and helping tobacco users quit can improve the health and quality of life.  People who stop smoking greatly reduce their risk of disease and premature death. Benefits are greater for people who stop at earlier ages, but quitting tobacco use is beneficial at any age. 

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will be a new, two year cooperative agreement with a state and national component. 
•	For the State Component, states and territories will be funded to ensure quitline capacity so that all callers to the quitline, particularly during a national media campaign such as Tips® campaign, are offered at least one coaching call, either immediately upon calling or by being re-contacted within two to three days. Additionally, states and territories will continue to expand the capacity of state tobacco control programs to implement evidence-based cessation interventions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam while also exploring new modalities for technology delivered cessation systems.
•	For the National component, an organization will be funded to operate and promote a linguistically and culturally appropriate nationwide quitline service for smokers who predominantly speak Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin), Korean, and Vietnamese (CKV) languages.  It is more efficient to provide an Asian-language quitline service on a national level, rather than relying on states to provide these services through their individual state quitlines.

The focus of the SCF Nonprofit Capacity Building Program is to fund organizations that provide training, technical assistance, and competitive financial assistance to faith-based and community-based nonprofit organizations to help them address the broad economic recovery issues present in their communities, including helping low-income individuals secure and retain employment, earn higher wages, obtain better-quality jobs, and increase access to State and Federal benefits and tax credits.  

(2) SFC Government Capacity Building Program
The focus of the SCF State, Local, and Tribal Government Capacity Building Program is to build the sustainability and effectiveness of the government entities that provide outreach to faith-based and community-based organizations.   Ultimately, these partnerships will enable local nonprofit organizations to better serve those in need and to increase nonprofit organizations' involvement in the economic recovery.  Government entities or their designees will use program funds to develop their capacity to serve as a resource to nonprofit organizations and other government agencies regarding ARRA funding/benefits to ensure that disadvantaged and hard-to-serve populations are aware of and understand how to access the benefits and services described in the ARRA.  Grantees also will use program funds to offer free capacity building services to nonprofit organizations to improve awareness of and access to ARRA efforts/benefits, improve nonprofits’ organizational capacities to be active participants in ARRA efforts, and facilitate partnerships between and among nonprofits and other government agencies.  For example, grantees could establish a beneficiary benefits clearinghouse for individuals and a funding opportunities clearinghouse for nonprofit organizations, provide outreach and education, and deliver training and technical assistance.

Congress initially authorized up to $1.75 billion in Federal funds through Fiscal Year (FFY) 2011. With the subsequent passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) in 2010, Section 2403 extended the program through September 30, 2016. An additional $2.25 billion in Federal funds was appropriated through FFY 2016. Since then, Section 2 of the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-3) added $112 million in Federal funds and changed the end date for the program from September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2021. Section 5 of the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-16) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid Extenders Act from $112 million to $132 million and Section 4 of the Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019 (P.L 116-39) changed the additional funding appropriated through the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act from $132 million to $254.5 million. Any funds remaining at the end of each fiscal year carry over to the next fiscal year, and can be used to make grant awards to current grantees through FY 2021. Any unused grant funds in 2021 can be used until 2025. No additional funding will be available after the final 2021 awards are made; however, grantees will submit documentation to identify projected costs and justify expenditures on an annual basis. Grantees can request to continue transitioning MFP participants until December 31, 2023 with services being provided and eligible for enhanced match through December 31, 2024. All claiming of services must be finalized by September 30, 2025. The MFP Demonstration supports State efforts to rebalance their long-term support system so that individuals have a choice of where they live and receive services. MFP program goals are (1) increase the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) and reduce the use of institutionally-based services; (2) eliminate barriers in State law, State Medicaid plans, and State budgets that restrict the use of Medicaid funds to let people get long-term care in the settings of their choice (3) strengthen the ability of Medicaid programs to provide HCBS to people who choose to transition out of institutions, and (4) put procedures in place to provide quality assurance and improvement of HCBS.  The demonstration provides for enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for 12 months for qualified home and community-based services for each person transitioned from an institution to the community during the demonstration period. Eligibility for transition is dependent upon residence in a qualified institution for more than 90 consecutive days. However, days that an individual was residing in the institution for the sole purpose of receiving short-term rehabilitation services that are reimbursed under Medicare are excluded and will not be counted toward the 90-day requirement. The State must continue to provide community-based services after the 12-month period for as long as the person needs community services and is Medicaid eligible.  Under the demonstration, the State must propose a system of Medicaid home and community-based care that will be sustained after the demonstration period and is deemed qualified by the Secretary. Specifically, the program must be conducted in conjunction with a ""qualified HCBS program"" which is a program that is in operation (or approved) in the State for such individuals in a manner that assures continuity of Medicaid coverage of services in the qualified HCBS program for eligible individuals. States may also propose to enhance the services they will provide during the demonstration period to achieve greater success with transition. States will be required to participate in a national qualitative and quantitative evaluation conducted by CMS. Data collected on a national level will help evaluate the core objectives of the statute."

The Goal is “a secure and resilient Nation with the capabilities required across the whole community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk”. The objective of the National Preparedness System is to facilitate an integrated, whole community, risk-informed, capabilities-based approach to preparedness.

The FY 2019 HSNTP CTG program provides funding to eligible applicants to target training solutions that are available and accessible to a nationwide audience to address emerging threats (specifically cybersecurity) and Community Lifelines (Lifelines) and specifically for Food, Water and Sheltering, Communications and Transportation Lifelines. Lifelines allow for decision makers to rapidly determine whether an incident is large or complex; prioritize and focus response efforts to maintain or restore the most critical services and infrastructure; ensure limited resources can go toward a common goal that requires involvement across the whole community and promote a response that fosters better integration and communication across the whole community since lifeline management transcends public and private sector boundaries. 
Objectives
The FY 2019 HSNTP CTG program’s purpose is to develop and deliver FEMA training that addresses the gaps that inhibit stabilization of Community Lifelines for the greatest impact on the Nation’s preparedness. FEMA and the CTG recipients will concentrate on long-term gaps—including rising disaster costs, new technology, an older and more diverse population, and cybersecurity. Having this focus during and after a disaster, rather than fixating on specific threats and hazards, enables communities to build a culture of preparedness and ready the Nation for catastrophic disasters.

Communities must focus finite resources on mitigating damages to seven lifelines. When they are disrupted, impacts to survivors erupt. Solutions require cross-sector coordination to unify the efforts of government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector. Lifelines provide an integrated framework across our missions. CTG applicants should effectively communicate how their proposed training will directly contribute to these critical functions.

National Domestic Preparedness Consortium
The National Domestic Preparedness Consortium duties as established and authorized are to identify, develop, test and deliver training to state, local, territorial and tribal emergency response providers; provide on-site and mobile training at the awareness, performance and management and planning levels; and facilitate the delivery of training by the training partners of the Department of Homeland Security.
The Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Homeland Security National
Training Program (HSNTP), National Domestic Preparedness Consortium (NDPC) provides
funding to eligible applicants to develop and deliver training solutions to address national
preparedness gaps, map training to the core capabilities, and ensure training is available and
accessible to a nationwide audience.

The FY 2019 NDPC plays an important role in the National Preparedness System to build,
sustain, and deliver core capabilities to achieve the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal).
The Goal is “a secure and resilient nation with the capabilities required across the whole
community to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from the threats and
hazards that pose the greatest risk”. The objective of the National Preparedness System is to
facilitate an integrated, whole community, risk-informed, capabilities-based approach to
preparedness. Complex and far-reaching threats and hazards require the engagement of
individuals, families, communities, private and nonprofit sectors, faith-based.  The FY 2019 NDPC will highlight lessons learned from the catastrophic disasters of 2017. The purpose is to ensure all FEMA training partners utilize a unified approach and work together on a national level to address the challenges with the greatest impact on the nation’s preparedness. Although the 2017 disaster season was characterized by major hurricanes and wildfires, future seasons could be defined by other types of incidents. Through collaboration, FEMA and the NDPC members will address long-term trends that influence national preparedness—including rising disaster costs, new technology, an older and more diverse population, and emerging threats such as cybersecurity. Focusing on capabilities rather than specific threats and hazards enables communities to build a culture of preparedness and ready the nation for catastrophic disasters."

This overarching programmatic goal of building state and local capabilities will be achieved through various means and methods, each one aimed at making achieving the National Preparedness Goal and furthering our collective efforts to remain a safe and secure nation. Specific program activities anticipated for achieving this goal will include, but will not be limited to: 
•	production and dissemination of written products relating to emerging homeland security, emergency management and public safety issues and established or model state homeland security and emergency management efforts;
•	providing educational seminars, training and workshops for apprising newly appointed Governor’s Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs) and Emergency Management Directors of federal homeland security doctrine, best-practices and established principles; 
•	facilitating calls, meetings, or discussions amongst representatives from key stakeholder groups on a regular basis which serve to share information, knowledge, experiences, and practices relating to current and emerging homeland security, emergency management and public safety issues; and, 
•	convening trainings, workshops, and other meeting opportunities designed to bring together in a common forum nationwide Homeland Security Advisors, state, local and tribal Emergency Management Directors, as well as other professional organizations in the public and private sectors and to inform partners on the impacts of federal homeland security, emergency management and public safety legislation, regulations and policies on the states.
Each recipient will conduct these specific activities to support either State Emergency Management Directors, Homeland Security Advisors to further build SLTT capabilities. An additional key purpose for the HSPTAP is that the program also furthers the building of a national system of emergency management capabilities that can effectively and efficiently utilize the full measure of the Nation's resources to respond to catastrophic incidents, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other man-made emergencies or events. HSPTAP recipients will conduct activities that bring together the collective perspectives of state and local elected officials and the private sector to provide a broad-based sounding board on homeland security issues for all national stakeholders. The program will serve to establish, provide, and maintain a forum for organizations to exchange ideas, conduct targeted discussions, as well as to provide technical assistance to governors’ offices, associations and organizations on all relevant homeland security policy areas. Finally, HSPTAP will engage the recipient organizations which can work closely with FEMA to develop, transfer, and institutionalize pertinent knowledge at the State and local level for addressing current public policy challenges facing State EM Directors, HSAs and other state and local emergency management officials. HSPTAP recipients, through collaboration with FEMA and other national, regional, state and local entities, will facilitate focused and enhanced communication and coordination among all disciplines and levels of government to address the complex challenges of developing and implementing homeland security policies and practices including: intelligence sharing; State homeland security organization, structure and governance; communications interoperability; critical infrastructure protection; and all hazards disaster prevention, protection, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery to include areas of emergency management, homeland security, fire, law enforcement, Emergency Management Services (EMS), agriculture, National Guard, emergency communications, and public works. In sum, in addition to building state and local capabilities, the activities conducted under the HSPTAP are structured to address the full spectrum of mission areas, national priorities, and core capabilities outlined in the National Preparedness System and are critical to achieving the National Preparedness Goal."

ACA – Testing a Model of Data Aggregation under the Comprehensive Primary Care initiative,,"CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, DEPARTMENT OF","The Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative is a multi-payer initiative fostering collaboration between public and private health insurance companies (“payers”) to strengthen primary care.  Recognizing that the impact of any one payer alone is limited, the payers in CPC have committed to establishing an approach that is coordinated with that of the Innovation Center to transform the way in which primary care is practiced and financially supported.  

In May-July 2012, the Innovation Center executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each participating payer.  One of the stated goals in the MOU is improving the flow of cost and utilization data to CPC primary care practices to support practices in their efforts to improve outcomes through care coordination and quality improvement.  The MOU described a collaboration by which each regional group of payers – with CMS’ input – would produce a written plan “that outlines how participating payers will transition to a common approach for sharing data with participating primary care practices.”

The MOU defined this endeavor in the following way:
. . . If an appropriately structured and protected multi-payer claims data system exists or can be created in [Market] to support a common approach for sharing data with participating primary care practices, the Innovation Center and [payer] will submit its data to the system.

In order to improve care coordination and support practices to provide better patient care, payers have agreed to work together to improve data-sharing to practices. The goal of data aggregation is to combine patient-level cost and utilization data from all payers in a uniform and actionable format so that physicians can better coordinate care across their entire population. This data will help CPC primary care practices deliver better care to their patients by providing information to support their efforts to improve care outcomes through care coordination and quality improvement.  CPC practices have been asking for this data to be aggregated for their practice rather than to receive it individually from each payer, which has been cumbersome and less useful for them in managing the health of their patients.  Payers in four CPC regions have been delivering data in this format, but Medicare data has not to date been included.  

The purpose of this program is to support vendors in four CPC regions to combine Medicare claims data with claims data from other commercial payers in each respective region and create actionable feedback reports for practices to improve care coordination and population health, and decrease costs.  The end-users of this aggregated data are the CPC practices; including Medicare data in this demonstration is central to the stated goal of improving care coordination by providing actionable data to primary care practices.  We are proposing to add Medicare data in CPC regions with existing multi-payer databases to test a model of data aggregation within the CPC initiative to better understand how Medicare data may be incorporated and used by practices to improve care coordination and quality improvement.  The activities funded by these cooperative agreements are projected to run for the duration of the CPC initiative, currently scheduled to end December 31, 2016.  

Specifically, these cooperative agreements are intended for vendors in four CPC regions:
	•	Taconic Health Information Network Community (THINC) in the Capital-District Hudson Valley region of New York;
	•	The Health Collaborative in the Cincinnati-Dayton region of southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky;
	•	MyHealth in the greater Tulsa region of Oklahoma; and 
	•	Rise Health in Colorado

The CPC payers in each region have selected the vendors listed above as their data aggregation vendors and have asked CMS to provide Medicare data to these vendors to be included in these existing multi-payer databases.  Each group of regional payers is structuring their data aggregation system independently (i.e. these efforts are not connected across regions). Each group of regional payers has already entered into contractual relationships with their respective vendors.  The data aggregation vendors, the intended awardees for these cooperative agreements, are establishing multi-payer claims databases specific to the payer data for the CPC practices in their geopgraphic region. CMS participation in the data aggregation initiative will pay for Medicare data to be incorporated into the multi-payer databases serving CPC practices in each respective region (New York, Ohio/Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Colorado)."

Emergency Management Performance Grants,EMPG ,"FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, HOMELAND SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF","The FY 2019 Emergency Management Performance Grant Program (EMPG) is set against the backdrop of a year in which the United States faced numerous and unprecedented homeland security challenges.  These included the three major hurricanes that devastated parts of Texas, Florida, and much of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as massive wildfires across the State of California.  In addition to these natural disasters, the Nation also responded to multiple incidents as part of the evolving threat landscape, including witnessing the first known terrorist attack executed against mass transportation on our soil; cyberattacks against critical port infrastructure; and mass casualty events involving both vehicles and active shooters. 

The National Preparedness Goal (the Goal) defines what it means to be prepared for such diverse and complicated events.  The National Preparedness System is the instrument the Nation employs to build, sustain, and deliver the core capabilities needed to achieve the goal of a more secure and resilient Nation.  The development and sustainment of these core capabilities is not exclusive to any single level of government or organization, but rather requires the combined effort of the whole community.  To that end, the FY 2019 EMPG represents one part of a comprehensive set of measures authorized by Congress and implemented by the Administration.  Among the five basic homeland security missions noted in the DHS Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, the EMPG supports the goal to Strengthen National Preparedness and Resilience.

The purpose of EMPG is to provide Federal funds to states to assist state, local, territorial, and tribal governments in preparing for all hazards, as authorized by Section 662 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (6 U.S.C. § 762) and the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 5121 et seq.).  Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes DHS/FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from all hazards and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the Federal Government, states, and their political subdivisions.  The Federal Government, through EMPG, provides direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title, to support a comprehensive all-hazards emergency preparedness system.  The FY 2019 EMPG will provide Federal funds to assist state, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support implementation of the National Preparedness System and the National Preparedness Goal (the Goal) of a secure and resilient Nation."

Cooperating Technical Partners,(CTP),"FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, HOMELAND SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF","The Cooperating Technical Partners (CTP) Program exists to strengthen and increase the effectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) through fostering strong Federal, State, Tribal, regional and local partnerships to reduce flood losses and promote community resiliency. The CTP Program supports Strengthening National Preparedness and Resilience, one of five basic missions of the DHS2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. Additionally, the program supports the National Mitigation Framework within the Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-8). 
The objectives of the CTP Program primarily support the mission and objectives of the NFIP’s Flood Hazard Mapping Program through FEMA’s flood hazard identification and assessment programs including the Risk MAP (Mapping, Assessment, and Planning) initiative. The vision for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that increases public awareness of flood hazard risk and leads to action that reduces flood risk to life and property. Risk MAP develops flood hazard data and maps for communities that have never had identified risks as well as building on effective flood hazard data and flood insurance rate maps. FEMA collaborates with a variety of stakeholders to achieve the following goals under Risk MAP:

•	Flood Hazard Data- Address gaps in flood hazard data to form a solid foundation for risk assessment, floodplain management, and actuarial soundness of the NFIP.
•	Public Awareness/Outreach- Ensure that a measurable increase of the public’s awareness and understanding of risk results in a measurable reduction of current and future vulnerability.
•	Hazard Mitigation Planning- Lead and support States, local, and Tribal communities to effectively engage in risk-based mitigation planning resulting in sustainable actions that reduce or eliminate risks to life and property from natural hazards.
•	Enhanced Digital Platform- Provide an enhanced digital platform that improves management of Risk MAP, steward of information produced by Risk MAP, and improves communication and sharing of risk data and related products to all levels of government and the public.
•	Alignment and Synergies- Align Risk Analysis programs and develop synergies to enhance decision-making capabilities through effective risk communication and management.

Information about Risk MAP (including goals, strategies, progress and success stories), can be found on FEMA’s website at http://www.fema.gov/risk-mapping-assessment-planning.

FEMA through the CTP Program seeks to build upon and enhance the existing capabilities of CTPs to increase local involvement in, and ownership of flood hazard identification, flood map maintenance, risk assessment, and risk communication to encourage responsible floodplain management and support their jurisdictional responsibilities as participating members of the NFIP.  They assist in the development and maintenance of flood risk data and Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and other risk related products, as well as other assistance in advancing their local and FEMA’s goals and objectives of Risk MAP and the NFIP program. Partnerships developed through FEMA’s CTP Program are in the best interest of State and local communities, the NFIP and the general public. FEMA is responsible for establishing and updating minimum Federal criteria and holds the final decision making responsibility for issuing the FIRMs and any revisions/updates, however, there are several mutually beneficial reasons for creating these partnerships to help produce risk identification and assessment data, and other products in support of the NFIP."

Objectives
Within this broader construct, the objective of the FY 2019 IPR is to provide funds to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) for the protection of critical transportation infrastructure and the travelling public from acts of terrorism and to increase the resilience of transportation infrastructure. 
Performance Metrics 
Performance metrics for this program are as follows: 
•	Percent Change in the relative risk score for the top fifty (50) most critical assets.  
•	Percentage of funding building new capabilities 
•	Percentage of funding sustaining existing capabilities 

Priorities
Given the evolving threat landscape, it is incumbent upon DHS/FEMA to continuously evaluate the national risk profile and set priorities that help ensure appropriate allocation of scarce security dollars.  In assessing the national risk profile for FY 2019, four priority areas emerge:
1)	Enhancing the protection of soft targets/crowded places; 
2)	Enhancing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and improvised explosive device (IED) prevention, detection, response, and recovery capabilities; 
3)	Enhancing cybersecurity; and
4)	Addressing emergent threats, such as unmanned aerial systems (UAS).

Likewise, there are several enduring security needs that crosscut the Transportation Sector and form a second tier of priorities that help ensure a comprehensive approach to securing the Nation’s transportation systems.  These are: 
1)	Effective planning;
2)	Training and awareness campaigns;
3)	Equipment and capital projects; and 
4)	Exercises.

Within this broader construct, the objective of the FY 2019 TSGP is to provide funds to eligible public transportation systems (which include intra-city bus, ferries, and all forms of passenger rail) for the protection of critical transportation infrastructure and the travelling public from acts of terrorism and to increase the resilience of transit infrastructure."

These devastating incidents necessitate the collective assets and contributions of many supporting organizations aligned through a coordinated structure.” 
Communities can address these challenges by using a systematic approach that builds on proven preparedness activities. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) provides stakeholders across the whole community with the shared vocabulary, systems, and processes to deliver the capabilities described in the National Preparedness System (NPS).

Radiological/Nuclear Detection Pilot Evaluations Program,,"HOMELAND SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF, HOMELAND SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF","The WCMP addresses a potential threat pathway in the maritime domain. This project reflects the priority that the department has placed on balancing risk against all potential threats. In the heretofore respects, this initiative addresses and is consistent with Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-8 priority areas of developing and enhancing a national preparedness system; building and sustaining preparedness and operational readiness throughout the Nation; and providing Federal financial assistance in preparedness efforts. 

The West Coast Maritime Pilot (WCMP) program is a Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) sponsored initiative designed to reduce the risk of small vessels (<300 gross tons) being used to transport illicit radiological/nuclear (rad/nuc) materials. Small vessels pose a significant risk because they are ubiquitous and they can transit US waterways relatively anonymously. The pilot program is being applied in two West Coast port regions: Washington State’s Puget Sound, and San Diego, CA.  San Diego was selected because of its military and commercial significance, large population density near the water, proximity to the US/Mexico border, and an existing Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC). 

The WCMP will provide maritime radiation detection capabilities for State and local authorities in Washington State’s Puget Sound and San Diego, California areas. The three-year pilot involves the development of a radiation detection architecture that reduces the risk of radiological and nuclear threats that could be illicitly transported on recreational or small commercial vessels.  The pilot will be conducted in close coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection.

The Puget Sound region and San Diego, with DNDO assistance, will leverage existing federal grant funding to support small vessel radiation detection programs and the procurement of recommended equipment. DNDO will be working with maritime partners and local authorities in both areas to assess the geographic configurations of the ports to maximize detection and interdiction opportunities. Additional analyses for local partners will include a baseline survey of the existing radiological and nuclear detection architecture, a gap and risk assessment, and associated recommended actions to be developed in conjunction with maritime stakeholders. Maritime stakeholders will also receive guidance from DNDO on operational protocols, training, and exercises that support small vessel radiation detection capabilities. 

The fundamental goal of the DNDO sponsored West Coast Maritime PRND Pilot Project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a limited-phased deployment of COTs/GOTs preventive rad/nuc detection capabilities and Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) against the small vessel threat in the Puget Sound and San Diego regions and gather lessons learned to improve effectiveness of a wider deployment of maritime capabilities to other priority US ports. 
Objectives for this pilot include:
1)	Deploy and evaluate an operational PRND detection and reporting capability consisting of human portable, mobile and fixed radiation detection systems for maritime applications. 
2)	Implement and evaluate a regional maritime PRND CONOPS with alarm resolution and MOTR protocols
3)	Develop, provide, and evaluate a maritime specific training, CONOPS, and protocols.
4)	Identify gaps in the maritime architecture, and provide user requirements for future CONOPS and system development efforts.
5)	Introduce and use Human Portable Radiation Detection System (HPRDS) Engineering Design Models (EDMs) when feasible in order to provide end user feedback to the HPRDS Program office.
