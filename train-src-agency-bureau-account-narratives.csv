IDA works across a wide range of sectors including education, health, clean water and sanitation, the environment, infrastructure, agriculture, and governance. Because countries receiving IDA financing are too poor to attract sufficient capital to support their significant development needs, they depend on concessional finance--low-cost loans and grants--to create jobs, build critical infrastructure, improve governance and public service delivery, increase agricultural productivity, increase access to energy, improve job creation and the business environment, and invest in the health and education of future generations. IDA's goal is to help countries reduce poverty and achieve higher levels of growth and institutional capacity. Over time, IDA's support helps countries finance their development needs through domestic revenues and borrowing at non-concessional rates, including through international markets.  During the World Bank's 2019 fiscal year (July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2019), IDA supported 268 projects totaling $22.3 billion, of which, just under two-thirds ($14.1 billion) went to countries in Africa. Countries in the South Asia region received the second largest amount ($4.8 billion). Multilateral Debt Relief InitiativeLaunched in 2006 at the urging of the United States, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent cancellation of eligible debt to the concessional financing windows of the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Countries receive MDRI benefits after completing the reforms under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and demonstrating a track record of improved economic policy performance. The purpose of this debt reduction is to free up more resources in well-performing low-income countries for poverty-reducing expenditures in areas such as health, education, and rural development. In accordance with the MDRI, donors compensate IDA for the cancelled debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis according to the payment schedules of the original loans. IDA calculates donors' MDRI commitments at the start of each three-year replenishment cycle according to a burden-sharing percentage. Each donor's commitments to MDRI at IDA must be met within the three-year replenishment period to avoid a negative impact on IDA's financial capacity.  The U.S. share of the cost of MDRI under IDA-19 (FY 2021-FY 2023) is $878.8 million. No funding is requested for IDA MDRI in 2021."

The NAB became effective on November 17, 1998. It is now the second line of defense for IMF resources after a prior arrangement, the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), lapsed on December 25, 2018. The amounts authorized for the GAB were also authorized to be used for the NAB.  A total of 40 countries and institutions participate in the NAB for a total of SDR 181 billion (about $250 billion), of which the current U.S. share is approximately SDR 28 billion (about $38.5 billion). The NAB is currently not activated, meaning that at present the IMF is relying on quota resources for current financing. In recent months, the United States joined other key countries and IMF leadership in advancing a package of actions to maintain overall IMF resources roughly at current levels in conjunction with reforms to IMF governance and lending, including substantive reforms to adjust IMF compensation and benefits in line with its role as a public institution. The United States successfully achieved its negotiating priorities during this process: (1) a decision to close the IMFs 15th review of quotas without changes to existing quota; (2) an agreement to maintain the IMF""s overall lending resources by renewing and doubling the size of the NAB, while reducing by a similar amount the IMF's bilateral borrowing agreements, in which the United States does not participate; and (3) preservation of U.S. veto power over the IMF's sources of lending. To implement the terms of the agreement, the Administration is seeking to double the current U.S. participation in the NAB to a total level of SDR 56,404,940,000 (approximately $78 billion using the current exchange rate), and to extend the U.S. participation in the NAB through December 31, 2025. Currently, Congress has authorized the U.S. to participate in the NAB until December 16, 2022. With respect to this account, resources provided by the United States under the NAB constitute an exchange of monetary assets and do not result in any budgetary outlays because such transactions result in an equivalent increase in U.S. international reserve assets in the form of an equal, offsetting, interest-bearing claim on the IMF. U.S. claims on the IMF under the NAB are readily available to meet a U.S. balance-of-payments financing need. (See the Analytical Perspectives for additional information.) Section 7065 of the 2021 General Provisions in this chapter includes the necessary legislative language to extend and increase the NAB."

It has two main financing windows: 1) the Asian Development Bank's Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR), which provides ""hard loans"" at market rates and ""soft loans"" to eligible countries at concessional rates; and 2) the Asian Development Fund (AsDF), which provides grants to the region's poorest countries that are at moderate or high risk of debt distress. Prior to January 2017, when AsDF's equity and lending operations were merged with AsDB's OCR, the AsDF also provided concessional loans.The AsDB provides long-term loans at market-based rates to 22 middle-income Asian countries that lack the resources to finance their national economies and build critical infrastructure. AsDB also supports private sector development with technical assistance, loans, guarantees, and direct equity investments in viable private sector projects with strong development impacts. In 2018, AsDB approved $18.3 billion for projects and leveraged another $13.7 billion in co-financing from official and commercial sources. Through its lending, AsDB supports the construction of critical infrastructure, the expansion of private enterprise, and sustainable economic growth. The majority of AsDB assistance is for investments in energy, transportation, agriculture and natural resources, public sector management, water supply, municipal infrastructure, finance, and education.

It focuses on supporting inclusive, sustainable economic growth, as well as regional cooperation and integration. AsDF projects support water, energy, transportation, infrastructure, financial sector deepening, agriculture, and health. AsDF also invests in cross-cutting activities, such as connecting entrepreneurial training with financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. In 2018, AsDF committed $1.4 billion in grants for AsDF-eligible countries. Cumulatively, AsDF has provided over $51 billion for projects in developing member countries since 1974. As a result of the merger of AsDF's lending assets into AsDB's OCR on January 1, 2017, AsDF now provides only grants.  In recent years, the United States has focused attention within AsDF on countries where support aligns with U.S. strategic interests, such as Afghanistan and the Pacific Island Countries."

In its 2019 fiscal year, the IFC approved $8.9 billion from its own resources, and mobilized an additional $10.2 billion from other sources, for 269 projects in 65 countries. Of this, $5 billion (26%) was invested in the poorest countries (those eligible for funding from the World Bank's IDA). By 2030, IFC is aiming to raise the percentage of new investments in the poorest countries and those experiencing conflict and fragility to 40% of its portfolio.  IFC made investments across the globe in 2019, with the largest recipient regions being Latin America and the Caribbean (32.5 percent), Sub-Saharan Africa (20.9 percent), East Asia and the Pacific (18.8 percent), and South Asia (15.7 percent). The top sectors for IFC investment in 2019 were financial markets (56.3 percent), infrastructure (11.8 percent), and agribusiness and forestry (5.6 percent).The IFC spent $295 million on advisory services in 2019, with sub-Saharan Africa receiving $96.5 million (33 percent).

In its 2019 fiscal year, the IFC approved $8.9 billion from its own resources, and mobilized an additional $10.2 billion from other sources, for 269 projects in 65 countries. Of this, $5 billion (26%) was invested in the poorest countries (those eligible for funding from the World Bank's IDA). By 2030, IFC is aiming to raise the percentage of new investments in the poorest countries and those experiencing conflict and fragility to 40% of its portfolio.  IFC made investments across the globe in 2019, with the largest recipient regions being Latin America and the Caribbean (32.5 percent), Sub-Saharan Africa (20.9 percent), East Asia and the Pacific (18.8 percent), and South Asia (15.7 percent). The top sectors for IFC investment in 2019 were financial markets (56.3 percent), infrastructure (11.8 percent), and agribusiness and forestry (5.6 percent).The IFC spent $295 million on advisory services in 2019, with sub-Saharan Africa receiving $96.5 million (33 percent).

The AfDF account includes a portion of the U.S. commitment to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).African Development BankThe FY 2021 Budget requests $54.6 million for the first of eight equal installments for the seventh general capital increase of the AfDB. The FY 2021 Budget also requests authorization to subscribe to the paid-in and callable capital shares allotted to the United States under the capital increase. The AfDB provides public sector financing at market-linked rates to 20 middle-income African countries, and provides loans, equity investments, lines of credit, and guarantees to support private sector investments in all 54 African member countries. The AfDB approved $7.0 billion in loans in 2019, 70 percent of which were for public sector projects and 30 percent for private sector projects. In 2019, approximately 48 percent of AfDB approvals were for infrastructure, primarily energy and transportation. Other key sectors include finance, agriculture, and governance. The United States is the largest non-regional shareholder of the AfDB, with 6.4 percent of total shareholding, and the second-largest shareholder after Nigeria. African Development FundThe FY 2021 Budget requests $171.3 million in support of AfDF programs over the fifteenth replenishment (AfDF-15; FY 2021-FY 2023), including towards the first of three installments to AfDF-15.The AfDF is the AfDB Group's concessional lending window, providing grants and highly concessional loans to the poorest countries in Africa, of which half are fragile or conflict-affected states. In 2019, the AfDF provided $2.1 billion in financing, technical assistance, and capacity-building activities to the 37 eligible countries. Many AfDF recipient countries are becoming new, emerging markets and growing U.S. trading partners.Other AfDF recipient countries, however, remain trapped in fragility, conflict, and poverty.  They are highly vulnerable to both internal and external shocks and are in need of special assistance to achieve basic levels of service delivery. The AfDF is one of the largest official financiers of infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa, committing approximately 60 percent of its funding to national and regional infrastructure projects in sectors such as energy, transportation, and water and sanitation. The remainder of its funding is devoted to governance, agriculture and food security, and human capital development (e.g., health and education). The AfDF also sets aside special funding for regional projects and fragile and transitioning states.  In total, approximately half of its resources are directed to fragile states.Multilateral Debt Relief InitiativeLaunched in 2006 at the urging of the United States, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent cancellation of eligible debt to the concessional financing windows of the World Bank and the AfDB. Countries receive MDRI benefits after completing the reforms under the HIPC Initiative and demonstrating a track record of improved economic policy performance. The purpose of this debt reduction is to free up more resources in well-performing low-income countries for poverty-reducing expenditures in areas such as health, education, and rural development. In accordance with the MDRI donors compensate AfDF for cancelled debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis according to the payment schedules of the original loans. Similar to IDA, AfDF calculates donors' MDRI commitments at the start of each three-year replenishment cycle according to a burden-sharing percentage. Donor commitments must be met within the three-year replenishment period to avoid a negative impact on the AfDF's commitment capacity.  The U.S. share of the cost of MDRI under AfDF-15 (FY 2021-FY 2023) is $68.0 million. No funding is requested for AfDF MDRI in 2021."

These programs have provided authority and appropriations to reschedule and/or reduce debt repayments to the U.S. Government, allowing beneficiary countries to increase poverty reduction expenditures in areas such as health, education, and rural development. Debt relief can also contribute to achieving other U.S. Government policy priorities.  The FY 2021 Budget requests $78 million for Treasury's Debt Restructuring account to pay for the cost of the United States' Paris Club debt relief funding for Somalia as part of HIPC, in the event that Somalia meets the conditions specified for debt relief by U.S. law and the HIPC Initiative and consistent with U.S. foreign policy considerations."

Pursuant to section 175 of the Trade Act of 1974, the budget estimates for the Commission are transmitted to Congress without revision by the President. The Administration's FY 2021 request for the Commission is $99.6 million, reflected in the Appendix table and appropriations language.Although the Commission has one program activity set forth in the Budget of the United States, the Commission's Strategic Plan for FY 2018-2022 sets two strategic goals that cover its programmatic responsibilities. The agency's goal to make sound, objective, and timely determinations in trade remedy proceedings focuses on its import injury and unfair import investigative responsibilities. The agency's goal to produce independent, objective, and timely analysis and information on tariffs, trade, and competitiveness encompasses two areas. First, it focuses on the agency's role to independently provide the highest caliber of information and analysis to U.S. policymakers in a timely manner to assist them when they are securing benefits to the United States in trade negotiations and when they enact legislation or take other policy actions that affect the U.S. economy and industry competitiveness. The Commission's analysis of industry competitiveness has expanded with new responsibilities for evaluating miscellaneous tariff bill (MTB) petitions and making recommendations to Congress under the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 (AMCA). Second, it focuses on the responsibility to maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States. The Commission also set a management goal to efficiently and effectively advance the agency's mission. The agency's focus is on four functional areas--human resources; budget, acquisitions, and finance; information technology; and processes and communications--as they play a critical role in supporting programmatic activities.The Strategic Plan identifies strategic objectives for each strategic or management goal, strategies to meet these objectives, and specific performance goals. The performance goals provide the basis by which the agency can assess whether it is making progress toward its strategic objectives.The Commission makes available its Strategic Plan, Agency Financial Report, Annual Performance Plan, Annual Performance Report, and Budget Justification at https://www.usitc.gov/strategic_plan.htm."

The Board's mission is to protect Federal merit systems and the rights of individuals within those systems. The MSPB accomplishes its mission by: hearing and deciding employee appeals from agency actions; hearing and deciding cases brought by the Office of Special Counsel involving alleged abuses of the merit systems, and other cases arising under the Board's original jurisdiction; conducting studies of the civil service and other merit systems in the Executive Branch to determine whether they are free from prohibited personnel practices; and providing oversight of the significant actions and regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to determine whether they are in accord with merit system principles. The MSPB's inception began in 1883, when the Congress passed the Pendleton Act establishing the Civil Service Commission and a merit-based employment system for the Federal Government. The Pendleton Act grew out of the 19th century reform movement to curtail the excesses of political patronage in Government. As the Commission's responsibilities multiplied, a growing consensus emerged that it could not properly and adequately perform managerial and adjudicatory functions simultaneously. Concern over the inherent conflict of interest in the Commission's role as both rule-maker and judge was a principal motivating factor behind the enactment by the Congress of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The Act replaced the Civil Service Commission with three new independent agencies: OPM, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and MSPB. MSPB assumed the employee appeals functions of the Commission and was given the new responsibilities to perform merit systems studies and to review the significant actions of OPM."

OSC may transmit whistleblower allegations to the agency head concerned and require an agency investigation. OSC submits the agency's investigative report to the President and the Congress when appropriate.OSC received 5,486 new cases in 2019. While the number of cases received was less than projected in 2019 due to the unprecedented partial Government shutdown, receiving 5,486 cases still represents a 39 percent increase over historical averages post-2000.  Additionally, OSC resolved 6,193 matters in 2019, an increase of 60 percent over the historical average post-2000 and the second highest total in agency history. Of the new cases received, 3,811 were prohibited personnel practice cases, a 45 percent increase over the historical average post-2000. OSC also obtained a record 329 favorable actions for Federal employees in response to prohibited personnel practice complaints.During 2019, OSC received 1,373 new disclosures, a 42 percent increase over the historical average post-2000. OSC processed and closed 1,479 disclosures, and referred 73 disclosures of waste, fraud, and abuse to agency heads for investigation. During the last several years, OSC has received numerous whistleblower disclosures from employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). OSC's work with VA whistleblowers has been featured in the media, and has helped promote accountability and improvements within VA. OSC continues to receive a disproportionately large number of cases from VA employees and, to address this, has established a priority intake system for VA claims.OSC conducts outreach and education activities on its program areas to inform and train agencies to prevent prohibited personnel practices, whistleblower reprisals, Hatch Act and USERRA violations, and claims of fraud, waste and abuse. In FY 2019, OSC conducted 188 outreach activities throughout the Federal Government.Cases Received 2019Cases Resolved 2019Case Type:Prohibited personnel practice complaints3,8114,447Hatch Act complaints281245Whistleblower Disclosures1,3731,479USERRA cases2122Totals5,4866,193For 2020 and 2021, OSC projects intakes for whistleblower disclosure, Hatch Act, and prohibited personnel practice cases to follow recent trends and stabilize at around 6,000 total new cases received each year. OSC's caseload will remain high in light of the ongoing issues at the VA, and the increased media exposure VA whistleblowers and whistleblowers in general are receiving.Overall, the funding requested for 2021 will enable OSC to meet demands for OSC's services, protect whistleblowers in the VA and other agencies, protect the employment rights of returning service members, and protect the Federal merit system from prohibited personnel and political practices."

The budget also proposes an amount for move, replication, and related costs associated with relocation under a replacement lease for the Commission's San Francisco Reginoal Office facilities. At this time, this amount is estimated at $12.7 million. These samounts would not be used for the operations of the SEC, and the proposed appropriations language provides a mechanism whereby any unused portion of these funds could be refunded to fee payers (or returned to the general fund of the Treasury) as rapidly as practicable."

appropriation supports core Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs through grants to States, Tribes and U.S. districts and Territories. Funding is provided to assist State and tribal partners in implementing their environmental programs to protect human health and the environment. EPA is using common elements for State and tribal grant agreements, including Performance Partnership Grants.The EPA will provide financial and technical assistance to assist States and Tribes in the development and management of their clean air plans and support solutions that address their local air quality management needs. EPA also will provide funds to States and Tribes using section 105 authority of the Clean Air Act to operate and maintain air monitoring networks to obtain data on emissions of criteria pollutants and air toxics. EPA has funded State and local fine particulate monitoring using the requirements of section 103 of the Clean Air Act, as authorized in annual appropriation bills. EPA also is committed to transitioning funding for fine particulate monitoring into the funding authorized by section 105 of the Clean Air Act. Section 103 provides full funding for pilot programs, demonstrations, research, and other one-time activities, whereas section 105 requires States and local agencies to provide matching funds of at least 40 percent of the amount required for the entire continuing State or local clean air program. Using funds provided by EPA under Clean Air Act sections 103 and 105, States and Tribes will prepare State Implementation Plans and Tribal Implementation Plans to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, implement monitoring requirements, and support the National Air Toxics Trends Stations monitoring network. Additionally, States may utilize funding to support States' collection, review, and use of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data and permitting of large sources of GHG's. EPA also will implement the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Grant Program by providing funding through grants and rebates to continue to reduce diesel emissions in priority areas and areas of highly concentrated diesel pollution.EPA also will support its partnerships with States, Tribes, and U.S. Territories through water grants and Performance Partnership grants to carry out core statutory requirements of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Funding supports work to reduce human exposure to contaminants in drinking water, fish and shellfish, and recreational waters and to protect and restore watersheds and aquatic ecosystems. Funding is provided through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) for States and Tribes to make low interest loans to public water systems to upgrade drinking water infrastructure to help them provide safe drinking water. In addition, Clean Water SRF funding provides low interest loans to communities and includes a set-aside for Tribes and U.S. Territories to construct wastewater treatment infrastructure, in addition to other projects that enhance water quality. In sum, the Federal Government has invested over $65 billion in grants to help capitalize the SRFs. With the required State match, additional State contributions, and funds from program leveraging, funds made available for loans total over $185 billion since their inception. EPA will continue to work with its partners to enhance the capacity of communities, States, and private investors to plan and finance drinking water and wastewater infrastructure improvements.Direct grants also are provided to help address the significant water and wastewater infrastructure needs of Alaska Native Villages. EPA has implemented a management plan that optimizes the pace of the program. EPA will continue to strengthen State core water quality protection and water enforcement programs.The Budget proposes funds for the America's Water Infrastructure Act and Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act grant programs that will assist in lead testing and drinking water fountain replacement in schools, reducing lead in drinking water, increasing resiliency at drinking water systems, sewer overflow control, and water infrastructure workforce investment. These resources would complement State and local drinking water and wastewater infrastructure investments as well as funding provided through other Federal channels.The Healthy Schools grant program will provide support to States, local governments, Tribes and non-profit organizations to address environmental health concerns found in schools. Funding supports efforts to identify and help prevent, reduce and resolve environmental hazards, prevent childhood lead exposure, reduce asthma triggers, promote integrated pest management and reduce or eliminate childhood exposure to toxics in schools.EPA's Brownfields program supports land revitalization by providing grants to States, Tribes, and local communities to assess and clean up real property which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. EPA Brownfields assessment and clean-up projects assist local communities in paving the way for the productive reuse of contaminated properties and abandoned sites. To the extent there are sufficient qualified applications, the Budget proposes to add language to provide no less than $18,000,000 for projects located in Qualified Opportunity Zones.Hazardous and non-hazardous wastes on the land can migrate to the air, groundwater, and surface water, contaminating drinking water supplies, causing acute illnesses or chronic diseases, and threatening healthy ecosystems in urban, rural, and suburban areas. Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended, EPA provides grants to States to strengthen their ability to implement hazardous waste programs. When appropriate, EPA also may provide financial and technical assistance to eligible tribal governments and inter-tribal consortia to conduct hazardous waste work in Indian Country.In addition, EPA provides grants to assist States, Tribes, and other partners with worker safety activities, protection of endangered species and water sources, and promotion of environmental stewardship. To protect, sustain or restore the health of people, communities and ecosystems, EPA focuses on the geographic areas with human and ecological communities at most risk. EPA is working to protect, sustain, and restore the health of natural habitats and ecosystems by identifying and evaluating problem areas, developing tools, and improving community capacity to address problems. EPA is proposing a new grant program focused on Harmful Algal Blooms reduction. Under Federal environmental statutes, EPA is responsible for protecting human health and the environment in Indian Country. EPA works with over 560 federally recognized Tribes located across the United States to improve environmental and human health outcomes. Indian Country totals more than 70 million acres, with reservations ranging from less than 10 acres to more than 14 million acres. EPA will provide funding to build and enhance the capacity of Tribes to address environmental and public health challenges in Indian Country, including lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation, adequate waste facilities, and other environmental safeguards taken for granted elsewhere.EPA will provide funding to States, U.S. Territories, Tribes, and inter-tribal consortia to help them develop their information management and technology capabilities. The purpose of this support is two-fold: to assist the Agency in providing ready access to real-time environmental information; and to allow States and Tribes to better integrate and share their environmental information.To promote compliance with laws intended to protect human health and the environment, EPA will continue to award State and tribal grants to assist in the implementation of compliance and enforcement provisions of environmental laws. EPA provides funding to States and Tribes for compliance assurance activities including inspections and enforcement case support activities. EPA programs will provide Pesticide Program State and Tribal Assistance Grants that support pesticide product and user compliance with provisions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) through cooperative agreements with States and Tribes. The cooperative agreements support State and tribal compliance and enforcement activities under FIFRA.Toxic Substance Compliance Grants are provided to States and Tribes to prevent or eliminate unreasonable risks to human health or the environment and to ensure compliance with toxic substance regulations. The grants support inspection programs associated with the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA), lead-based paint (402(a), 406(b), and the Renovation, Repair and Painting rule [RRP]), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The compliance monitoring activities conducted by the States will be a cooperative endeavor addressing the priorities of the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act program and State toxics program issues."

In addition, the Administrator will employ persons in the Office of Research and Development under the authority provided in 42 U.S.C. 209. Furthermore, the Budget proposes to expand ORD's student contractor hiring authority to the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention and the Office of Water. These activities prioritize robust science and refocus the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) research and scientific analysis to inform EPA policy and regulatory development actions in a manner which creates consistency and certainty for the regulated community to ensure good stewardship and positive environmental outcomes. This appropriation supports core Agency programs and each of the Agency's three goals. Specifically in 2021, EPA will place emphasis on the following:The Air and Energy program (A-E) will conduct a range of science and technology activities to develop and implement strategies to improve air quality. These include: research to inform the review of the national ambient air quality standards to improve understanding of ozone, particulate matter, lead, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide; system research and life cycle analysis to understand the production, operation, and impacts of energy systems on health and the environment; research on the generation, fate, transport, and chemical transformation of air emissions to identify individual and population health risks to inform clean air management decisions; and development and evaluation of new approaches for monitoring levels of air pollutants (including air toxics). EPA further develops tools to provide technical assistance to State and local governments and Tribes to use in developing clean air plans to achieve air quality standards. EPA will continue to implement the renewable fuels provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140), and will develop, implement, and ensure compliance with regulatory programs that will significantly reduce emissions from highway and non-road sources.The Safe and Sustainable Water Resources research program (SSWR) conducts research to meet the science needs in EPA's water program, including: evaluating groups of contaminants for the protection of human health and the environment; developing innovative tools, technologies, and strategies for managing water resources (including stormwater); and supporting a systems approach for protecting and restoring aquatic systems. The systems approach includes: research to inform setting water quality criteria; establishing measures to assess and manage watersheds; and developing effective source control and management methods, especially for urban uses. A major component of the research program is working to support EPA's Drinking Water Strategy. Within the SSWR program, research will assess, develop, and compile scientifically rigorous tools and models that will be used by the Agency, States, Tribes, and municipalities to address issues such as lead in drinking water and excess nutrient loading.The Sustainable and Healthy Communities (SHC) research program, including Superfund research, implements system-based research to develop a new generation of smart technologies to address environmental conditions in a community. Superfund research costs are appropriated to the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund appropriation and transferred to this account to allow for proper accounting. The SHC research program develops decision support tools to enable communities' decision makers to solve complex human health and environmental problems. The program will identify health risks and stressors, especially those that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. The decision support tools support critical policy, regulatory, and non-regulatory needs related to contaminated site remediation, children's health protection, waste management, and our economy's reliance on quality ecosystem goods and services. These tools account for the interrelationships between social, economic, health, ecological, and environmental factors with the aim to minimize unintended consequences that can result from decisions about land use, transportation, and solid waste management, as well as promote more robust and efficient infrastructure.The Health and Environmental Risk Assessment (HERA) program develops assessments and scientific products that are used extensively by EPA's Program and Regional offices, and other parties, to estimate the potential risk to public health from exposure to environmental contaminants, to develop regulatory standards, and to manage environmental clean-ups. This includes EPA's All Ages Lead Model which predicts lead concentration in body tissues and organs for a hypothetical individual, based on a simulated lifetime of lead exposure. The HERA research program provides the scientific foundation for Agency actions to protect public health and the environment.The Homeland Security Research Program (HSRP) will continue to support research efforts on evaluating chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) analytical methods. The HSRP will conduct research on decontamination and methods to manage potential public health consequences and develop methods to protect water infrastructures and assess threats and consequences. In 2021, decontamination research will continue to address existing scientific knowledge gaps in responding to and recovering from wide-area CBR attacks on urban centers and public areas. Water Infrastructure Protection Research will focus on developing and testing decontamination approaches for water infrastructure and on treating CBR contaminated water caused by terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and/or accidents. Research on real-time distribution system models and methods to isolate and treat contaminated water, clean distribution systems, redirect water, and return water systems to service quickly and affordably is in progress. EPA also will continue to support water sector-specific agency responsibilities to protect the Nation's critical water infrastructure.EPA's Chemical Safety for Sustainability research program (CSS) is designed to strengthen the Agency's ability to evaluate and predict the potential environmental and human health impacts from use of manufactured chemicals throughout their lifecycle. The CSS program supports the development and application of improved and new computational systems; models of pathways and tissues; rapid cost-efficient exposure models; and user-friendly web-based tools for analysis and decision support. The CSS program will continue to develop approaches for using toxicity and exposure data to inform screening and prioritization of the over 40,000 chemicals currently on the TSCA Active List, and will continue to inform the Agency's implementation of key environmental regulations and to address contaminants of emerging concern, such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS). As it relates to the Science and Technology account and the overall mission of EPA, the protection of human health includes: ensuring the availability of appropriate analytical methods for detecting pesticide residues in food and feed; ensuring suitability for monitoring pesticide residues; and enforcing tolerances. The program accomplishes this by developing and validating multi-residue pesticide analytical methods for food, feed, and water for use by other Federal and State laboratories and EPA's programs and regions. Laboratories further support the estimation of human health risks from pesticide use by operating the National Pesticide Standard Repository (NPSR).EPA's Forensics Support program provides expert scientific and technical support for criminal and civil environmental enforcement cases, as well as technical support for the Agency's compliance efforts. EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC) is an environmental forensic center accredited for both laboratory and field sampling operations that generate environmental data for law enforcement purposes. It is fully accredited under International Standards Organization 17025, the main standard used by testing and calibration laboratories, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences (see Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, National Academy of Sciences, 2009). The NEIC maintains a sophisticated chemistry laboratory and a corps of highly trained inspectors and scientists with expertise across media. The NEIC works closely with EPA's Criminal Investigation Division to provide technical support (e.g., sampling, analysis, consultation, and testimony) to criminal investigations. The NEIC also works closely with EPA's Program and Regional Offices to provide technical support, consultation, on-site inspection, investigation, and case resolution services in support of the Agency's Civil Enforcement program.EPA's internal operations programs provide centralized management services to ensure that EPA is fulfilling its mission. The office and the functions it performs is: Office of Mission Support (facilities infrastructure and operations and information technology/data management).  "

This appropriation supports core agency programs implementing environmental statutes.To protect and improve air quality, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) applies a variety of approaches and tools. These include: developing and implementing strategies to attain ambient air quality standards for the six criteria pollutants; reducing regional haze through regional approaches where significant transport of pollutants occurs; and developing control measures for sources that are appropriately regulated at the Federal level. EPA develops and issues national technology-based and risk-based standards using a sector-based approach to reduce the quantity of toxic air pollutants emitted from industrial and manufacturing processes, as well as from urban sources. The Acid Rain program will continue its market-based approach to achieving reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide, primarily from electric utilities. The market-based approach also will be used in other programs, where permitted under the Clean Air Act, to reduce emissions of air pollutants. EPA will work with States and sources to implement the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule to obtain high quality data in a cost-effective manner. In addition, EPA will develop and use public information and training to reduce public exposure to radiation. EPA will focus its domestic efforts to ensure that ozone-depleting substance production and import caps under the Montreal Protocol and Clean Air Act continue to be met. The Budget includes a proposal to authorize EPA to administer the ENERGY STAR program through the collection of user fees, which would be collected and obligated out of the Environmental Programs and Management Account. By administering the ENERGY STAR program through the collection of user fees, the EPA would continue to provide a trusted resource for consumers and businesses who want to purchase products that save them money and help protect the environment.EPA works to protect and restore our waters to ensure that drinking water is safe, and that aquatic ecosystems sustain fish, plants and wildlife, as well as support economic, recreational, and subsistence activities. EPA will focus on core statutory requirements and water infrastructure. EPA will support the following Clean Water Act program components: water quality criteria, standards and technology; National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES); water monitoring; Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs); watershed management; water infrastructure and grants management; core wetlands programs and Clean Water Act section 106 program management. EPA also will work with States and Tribes to reduce risks to drinking water contaminants, for example, through proposed revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule. In addition, EPA will continue work with States to transition to the next generation management and reporting tool, the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Prime used by the majority of state drinking water programs. The new SDWIS Prime management and reporting tool will provide improvements in program efficiency and data quality, greater public access to drinking water data, facilitation of electronic reporting, reductions in reporting burdens on laboratories and water utilities, reductions in data management burdens, and ultimately reduction in public health risk.EPA's programs work to preserve land by ensuring proper management of waste under multiple environmental statutes. EPA will continue to assist States in putting in place and maintaining permits at facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste. Although States are the primary implementers of the Corrective Action program, which requires facilities managing hazardous waste to clean up past releases, EPA directly implements the program in six States and provides technical support and oversight for State activities. EPA also works with Tribes to maintain tribal underground storage tank (UST) programs. EPA also supports the operations and management of the Brownfields program, including training and technical support to assist communities to address issues associated with redevelopment or reuse of properties that may be complicated by the presence of contamination. EPA works with State, local, and tribal partners to help protect the public and the environment from releases of hazardous substances from chemical handling facilities by helping them develop area-wide emergency response and contingency plans. EPA conducts audits and inspections of those facilities handling more than a threshold quantity of certain extremely hazardous chemicals and that are required to implement a Risk Management Program to prevent releases. The Budget proposes to institute a voluntary fee whereby owners and/or operators of chemical facilities can choose to pay EPA for on-site compliance assistance with the Risk Management Program. The collected fees will be deposited in the Environmental Programs and Management Account and used by EPA to pay for this service.In collaboration with our tribal government partners, EPA works to strengthen human health and environmental protection in Indian Country. EPA works to ensure that its environmental protection programs are implemented in Indian Country either by EPA or by the Tribes. EPA will continue the direct implementation assessment to better understand EPA direct implementation responsibilities and activities on a program-by-program basis in Indian Country. Also, EPA provides resources and technical assistance for federally recognized Tribes to create and maintain effective environmental programs by collaborating with Tribes to develop long-term EPA-Tribal Environmental Plans (ETEP) for all federally recognized Tribes.To ensure that food will be free from unsafe levels of pesticide residues, EPA applies strict health-based standards in establishing and reevaluating tolerances for residues in food or animal feed. EPA also works to expedite the registration of reduced risk pesticides when possible, and to ensure that older pesticides meet current health and environmental standards. To respond to emerging health issues, EPA develops methods to evaluate the efficacy of products intended to combat public health pests. EPA intends to reduce potential human and environmental risks from commercial and residential exposure to pesticides through programs that focus on farm worker protection, pollinator health and protection, endangered species protection, environmental stewardship, and integrated pest management. EPA's toxics program will continue to make substantial progress in protecting public health and the environment from potentially harmful industrial chemicals by assessing the safety of new and existing chemicals, reducing gaps in the availability of chemical data, strengthening management of chemical information, and providing easier and more complete public access to non-confidential chemical data. EPA will conduct existing chemical prioritization and evaluations under the provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the Twenty-First Century Act, and address any unreasonable risks identified through such evaluations.EPA will engage both bilaterally and through multilateral institutions to improve international cooperation to prevent and address the transboundary movement of pollution and coordinate with other nations to protect the environment and human health.Combined with public demand for information, unprecedented changes in information technology are altering the way EPA, States, and Tribes collect, manage, analyze, use, secure, and provide access to quality environmental information. EPA is working with the States and Tribes to strengthen our information quality, leverage information maintained by other government organizations, and develop new tools that provide the public with simultaneous access to multiple data sets, allowing users to understand local, tribal, State, regional, and national environmental conditions. Key to achieving information quality will be the further development of the National Environmental Information Exchange Network, which is primarily an affiliation between EPA and the States and Tribes. EPA will continue to reduce reporting burdens, improve data quality, and accelerate data publications by accelerating the replacement of paper-based submissions with electronic reporting under the Toxic Release Inventory and other programs.EPA works in partnership with State and tribal agencies to enforce and build compliance with Federal environmental laws passed by the Congress that ensure our communities have clean air, water, and land. EPA will enforce environmental laws to correct noncompliance and promote cleanup of contaminated sites. To improve compliance with environmental laws, EPA works to provide easy access to tools that help regulated entities, Federal agencies, and the public understand these laws and find efficient, cost-effective means for putting them into practice. EPA's enforcement program targets inspections and other compliance monitoring activities according to the degree of health and environmental risk. The program collaborates with the Department of Justice, States, local government agencies, and tribal governments to ensure consistent and fair enforcement of all environmental laws and regulations. The program seeks to aggressively pursue violations that threaten communities, ensure a level economic playing field by ensuring that violators do not realize an economic benefit from noncompliance, and deter future violations. The Civil Enforcement program develops, litigates, and settles administrative and civil judicial cases against serious violators of environmental laws. The Criminal Enforcement program enforces the nation's environmental laws through targeted investigations of criminal conduct, committed by individual and corporate defendants, that threatens public health and the environment. Bringing criminal cases sends a strong deterrence message to potential violators, enhances aggregate compliance with laws and regulations and protects our communities. In 2020, to maximize compliance, the Agency will refocus efforts towards areas with significant noncompliance issues and where enforcement can address the most substantial impacts to human health and the environment.EPA's internal operations programs provide centralized management services and leadership to ensure that EPA is fulfilling its mission. The offices and the functions they perform within the Environmental Programs and Management appropriation are: the Office of Mission Support (facilities, infrastructure and operations; acquisition management; human resources management services; grants and interagency agreements; suspension and debarment; administrative law exchange network; information security; information technology/data management); the Office of the Administrator (civil rights/Title VII compliance; congressional, intergovernmental and external relations; Science Advisory Board; children's health; Small Business Ombudsman; Small Minority Business Assistance; Environmental Justice; NEPA Implementation; and regulatory and economic management and analysis work); the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (strategic planning, annual planning and budgeting, financial services, financial management, analysis, and accountability); and the Office of the General Counsel (FOIA management, civil rights/Title VI compliance, and legal advice). Since these centralized services provide support across EPA, many of these programs are funded across EPA's appropriations. "

With this funding, MTW agencies will provide housing assistance to over 450,000 families. This is the Department of Housing and Urban Development's first request for a separate MTW account for the MTW demonstration program. Of the $5.2 billion, $672 million represents funding that would otherwise be in the Public Housing Fund account, and $4.5 billion represents funding that would otherwise be in the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) account. This funding request is based on the total combined need for both the current 39 MTW PHAs and the approximately 30 PHAs that will receive MTW designation in 2020 through the first cohort of the MTW expansion. The Budget does not request additional funds for MTW agencies compared to non-MTW PHAs. Through the MTW account, MTW PHAs would receive the same amount of funding that they would have otherwise received through the separate Public Housing and TBRA accounts. The Budget authorizes HUD to transfer funds if necessary to equalize the proration between MTW and non-MTW agencies. The MTW account would, first, eliminate administrative burden for both MTW PHAs and HUD by reducing the number of funding accounts that must be managed and reconciled for these agencies. Second, it would simplify the tracking of funds, since all funds would be traced back to the MTW account.  Third, it would provide greater transparency regarding funding needs of the MTW demonstration program. Further, the Budget continues to support legislative reforms as reflected in the Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 and uniform work requirements. "

This funding includes both National Intelligence Program (NIP) and non-NIP resources. Even though these two offices are different and distinct in their missions, they work closely together and collaborate with other departmental component agencies and related Federal agencies, as well as State, local, tribal, foreign, and private-sector partners, to improve intelligence analysis, information sharing, incident management support, and situational awareness. I&amp;A's mission is to equip the Homeland Security Enterprise with the timely intelligence and information it needs to keep the homeland safe, secure, and resilient. I&amp;A is the interface between the Intelligence Community (IC) and Federal, State, local, and private sector homeland security partners, providing strategic analyses, warning, and actionable intelligence, ensuring departmental leadership, components, law enforcement, and IC partners have the tools they need to confront and disrupt terrorist threats.

The Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis leads I&amp;A and is the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer responsible for overseeing the DHS Intelligence Enterprise. The Under Secretary is also responsible for implementing the National Strategy on Information Sharing across the Department. The mission of OPS is to provide operations coordination, information sharing, situational awareness, the common operating picture, and Department continuity, enabling execution of the Secretary's responsibilities across the homeland security enterprise.

OPS provides situational awareness, assessments, and operations coordination for the DHS Secretary and facilitates operational information sharing with all DHS components, as well as for Federal, State, local, tribal, private sector, and international partners. OPS supports the DHS mission to lead the national unified effort to secure America by maintaining the National Operations Center (NOC) and by providing 24/7 multi-agency organization, fusing law enforcement, national intelligence, emergency response, and private sector reporting. The NOC is the primary national-level hub for domestic incident management, operations coordination, and situational awareness."

Additionally, audits will be conducted to assess the IRS's implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The core of TIGTA's audit work will continue to focus on high-risk tax administration areas, such as: 1) improving enforcement of tax law changes, security of taxpayer data, tax compliance, tax systems, and online services to increase revenue; 2) identity theft detection and prevention, fraudulent claims, and improper payments to enhance the efficiency of the IRS; and 3) monitoring the progress of the IRS in achieving its strategic goals.TIGTA's Office of Investigations (OI), concentrates on three areas: 1) employee integrity; 2) employee and infrastructure security; and 3) external attempts to corrupt tax administration.  Conducting investigations in these areas protect the public's confidence in the tax system from allegations of IRS employee misconduct, protecting IRS facilities and data, and investigating allegations of bribery or impersonation of the IRS.  OI's investigative program protects the ability of the IRS to process 253 million tax returns and collect more than $3.5 trillion in annual revenue for the Federal Government.TIGTA's Office of Inspections and Evaluations (I&amp;E) will identify opportunities for improvement in IRS and TIGTA programs by performing inspections and evaluations that report timely, useful, and reliable information to decisionmakers and stakeholders. The oversight activities of I&amp;E include inspecting the compliance of the IRS with established system controls and operating procedures, as well as evaluating the Agency's operations for high-risk systemic inefficiencies."

Under the control of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Chief Information Officer (CIO), this centralized fund ensures that investments in information sharing technology are well-planned and aligned with the Department's overall IT strategy and enterprise architecture. The current major initiatives/projects are described below.Cybersecurity.--Enhancing cybersecurity remains a top priority for the Department and its leadership as DOJ supports a wide range of missions that include national security, law enforcement, prosecution, and incarceration. For each of these critical missions, the systems that support them must be secured to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information, the availability of data and workflows crucial to mission execution, and the integrity of data guiding critical decision-making.IT Transformation.--IT Transformation is a long-term, multiyear commitment that implements shared IT infrastructure for the Department and shifts investments to the most efficient computing platforms, including shared services and next generation storage, hosting, networking, and facilities. This directly supports the Federal CIO's 25 Point Plan to Reform Federal IT Management and the Portfolio Stat process, and aligns the Department's IT operations with the Federal Data Center Consolidation and Shared First initiatives. Work on these initiatives began in 2012, and consists of the following projects: a) e-mail consolidation; b) data center consolidation; c) mobility and remote access; and d) desktops. In 2021, DOJ will continue to leverage Schedule A hiring authority with a goal of bringing on board private sector IT subject matter experts to progress IT transformation already underway within the Department's Office of the CIO (OCIO). These experts, with varied skill sets from data architects, application hosting, and business intelligence, will assist OCIO and component customers in moving forward on respective IT initiatives in support of the DOJ mission. Additionally, the OCIO will leverage U.S. Digital Service expertise in its effort to drive innovation in key IT management areas, such as with Digital Acquisition Innovation Labs. OCIO will also continue to leverage its authority under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), through the Department's IT Investment Review Council (DIRC) and Investment Review Board (DIRB), and through the TechStat process, to ensure that all Department IT projects and initiatives are meeting expected milestones and remain within project scope and budget.Policy, Planning and Oversight.--JIST funds the Office of the CIO and the Policy &amp; Planning Staff (PPS), which supports CIO management in complying with the Clinger-Cohen Act, the FITARA, and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations for federal information resource management. Within OCIO, PPS develops, implements, and oversees an integrated approach for effectively and efficiently planning and managing DOJ's information technology resources, including the creation of operational plans for JIST and monitoring the execution of funds against those plans. PPS is responsible for IT investment management including portfolio, program, and project management. The investment management team manages the Department's IT investment and budget planning processes; develops and maintains the Department's general IT program policy and guidance documents; and coordinates the activities of the DIRB DIRC. In addition, PPS performs reviews to examine planned IT acquisitions and procurements to ensure alignment with the Department's IT strategies, policies, and its enterprise road map."

The rural housing voucher program is authorized under section 542 of the Housing Act of 1949 and may be used to assist families displaced when the mortgage on the RHS-financed rural rental housing projects is prepaid or paid in full. A voucher can be used in lieu of rental assistance, which is no longer available once the property is paid-off in full.

The Budget also requests that residents receiving rental assistance payments will be required to pay a minimum rent of $50 per month, unless the Department determines a lower amount because the tenant qualifies for a hardship exemption. Of the total amount provided, the Budget requests $40 million for housing vouchers, which can be for prepayments and pay-offs. The vouchers related to prepayments will be awarded based on prioritization of need as determined by the Secretary. In addition, all balances related to the rural housing voucher program will be transferred and merged into this account from the Multifamily Housing Revitalization Account.From 1978 through 1991, the rental assistance program was funded under the Rural Housing Insurance Fund (RHIF). Beginning in 1992, pursuant to Credit Reform, a separate grant account was established for this program. Prior year obligations are funded with ""such sums"" amounts to cover those pre-credit reform contracts in RHIF."

It does so by receiving and disclosing reports filed by unions, union officers and employees, employers, labor consultants, and others in accordance with the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), including union financial reports and employer and consultant activity reports. To ensure financial integrity, OLMS audits union financial records and investigates possible embezzlements of union funds. To ensure democracy, OLMS conducts union officer election investigations and supervises reruns of union officer elections pursuant to voluntary settlements or after court determinations that elections were not conducted in accordance with the LMRDA. In addition, OLMS administers a statutory program to certify employee protection provisions are included in grants and contracts under various Federally-sponsored transportation programs.  In FY 2021, the restoration of the OLMS core enforcement program will advance union democracy, transparency, and financial integrity protections by increasing the number of compliance audits to 535 to include all levels of union governance, conducting 365 criminal investigations, and expanding compliance assistance efforts. In addition, OLMS will ensure that federally sponsored transportation grants are processed in a timely manner and that they provide requisite protection to employees against adverse impacts that could result from projects funded with federal assistance. OLMS will also be included in the implementation of the Department's Enterprise Shared Services Delivery model for IT Services in support of the President's Management Agenda and will realign two (2) FTE to the Office of the Chief Information Officer for that initiative.

These set-asides include up to $10 million for grants to PHAs for capital needs arising from emergency situations or non-Presidentially declared natural disasters; up to $30 million for competitive grants to facilitate the demolition of physically obsolete public housing properties; up to $23 million to support ongoing  Public Housing Financial and Physical Assessment activities; up to $40 million to assist PHAs that are in receivership, designated troubled or substandard, experiencing insolvency, or otherwise at risk; $35 million for competitive grants to address lead-based paint hazards in Public Housing; and up to $30 million for competitive grants to PHAs for full lead service line replacement where the local public water system is undertaking a comprehensive water main replacement program.The Budget also reflects that PHAs with the Moving to Work (MTW) designation will be receiving funds from the MTW account, instead of the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance and Public Housing accounts.  The separate MTW account includes $672 million to fund MTW PHAs' Public Housing Fund allocations. Further, the Budget continues to support legislative reforms as reflected in the Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 and uniform work requirements."

The JVA requires the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) to act on behalf of the Secretary in the promulgation of policies and regulations that ensure maximum employment and training opportunities for veterans and priority of service for veterans (38 U.S.C. 4215) within the State workforce delivery system for employment and training programs funded in whole or in part by the U.S. Department of Labor. Under the JVA, grants are allocated to the States according to the statutory formula to support Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists and Local Veterans' Employment Representative (LVERs) staff. DVOP specialists (38 U.S.C. 4103A) provide intensive services to meet the employment needs of eligible veterans. DVOP specialists place maximum emphasis on assisting veterans with significant barriers to employment.LVER staff (38 U.S.C. 4104) conduct outreach to employers, employer associations, and business groups to promote the advantages of hiring veterans. LVERs also facilitate employment, training, and placement services provided to veterans under the applicable State employment service delivery system, including American Job Centers by educating all workforce partner staff on current employment initiatives and programs for veterans. In addition, each LVER provides reports to the manager of the State employment service delivery system and to the State Director for Veterans Employment and Training (38 U.S.C. 4103) regarding the State's compliance with Federal law and regulations with respect to special services and priorities for eligible veterans.Transition Assistance Program (TAP).--This program provides employment workshops for separating service members and their spouses to prepare these individuals for entry into the civilian workforce and job market. Its primary goal is to facilitate the transition from military to civilian employment. VETS coordinates with federal agencies including the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security to provide transition services to military service members separating from active duty. The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act instructed responsbile agencies to improve TAP and directed DOL to deliver a mandatory one-day employment planning workshop for all transitioning service members, as well as optional days of instruction on general employment preparation and Vocational Training for transitioning service members interested in apprenticeship opportunities and technical careers. National Veterans' Training Institute (NVTI).--NVTI develops and supplies competency-based training to Federal and State providers of services to veterans (38 U.S.C. 4109). NVTI is administered through a contract and supported by dedicated funds. NVTI ensures that these service providers receive a comprehensive foundation so they can effectively assist job-seeking veterans.Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program (HVRP).--HVRP (38 U.S.C. 2021) provides grants to States or other public entities, as well as to non-profits, including faith-based organizations.  Grantees operate employment programs to assist homeless veterans reintegrate into meaningful employment and stimulate the development of effective service delivery systems that will address the complex problems facing homeless veterans. VETS partners with the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development to promote multi-agency-funded programs that integrate the different services needed by homeless veterans. HVRP grants are provided for both urban and rural areas.Federal management.--VETS' Federal management budget activity supports the Federal administration of 38 U.S.C.  41, 42, and 43. This allows VETS to carry out programs and develop policies to provide employment and training opportunities designed to meet the needs of veterans (38 U.S.C. 4102-4115). It also enables VETS to discharge its responsibilities to administer, interpret, and help enforce the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C.  4301-4335, by providing technical assistance and investigating complaints received from veterans and service members who believe their employment and reemployment rights were violated. This budget activity enables VETS to investigate complaints received from veterans who claim a violation of their veterans' preference rights in Federal hiring pursuant to the Veterans' Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), 5 U.S.C.  3330a. VETS' Federal Contractor Program (VETS-4212) is also supported under this activity, pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  4212. These responsibilities involve the administration of a system whereby Federal contractors submit reports setting forth their affirmative action efforts to hire and retain eligible veterans.Resources under the Federal management activity are also used to evaluate the job training and employment assistance services provided to veterans under the Jobs for Veterans State Grants (38 U.S.C. 4102A(b)(5)), and the Homeless Veterans Reintegration (38 U.S.C. 2021). VETS personnel provide technical assistance to grantees to ensure they meet negotiated and mandated performance goals and other grant provisions.Federal management supports the oversight and development of policies for TAP (10 U.S.C. 1144 and 38 U.S.C. 4113). Through outreach and education efforts, such as job fairs, VETS staff raise the awareness of employers about the benefits of hiring veterans. The activities of the Advisory Committee for Veterans Employment, Training, and Employer Outreach (38 U.S.C. 4110) also are supported through this budget activity. In addition, through fee collection, the federal management activity fund administrative processes associated with the HIRE VETS Medallion program."

Control Grant program is to reduce the exposure of young children to lead-based paint and other environmental hazards in their homes, including protecting them from permanent developmental problems and asthma, and exposure to pesticides and carbon monoxide.The program plays a critical role in addressing the number one environmental disease impacting children: lead poisoning. The Budget requests $360 million, including $240 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Lead Hazard Control Program; $45 million for the Healthy Homes Program; $40 million for Resident Safety demonstrations of carbon monoxide and radon interventions; $30 million for a demonstration of lead testing in Housing Choice Vouchers units; and $5 million for lead-based paint technical studies and support. The Budget includes an appropriations provision that would allow the transfer of unobligated balances and recaptured funds from undersubscribed competitive programs to other competitive programs experiencing oversubscription.The Lead Hazard Control Grant Program provides grants of $1 million to $5 million to State and local governments and Indian Tribes for control of lead-based paint hazards in pre-1978 private low-income rental and owner-occupied housing. The grants are also designed to facilitate the development of a housing maintenance and rehabilitation workforce trained in lead-safe work practices and a certified hazard evaluation and control industry. In awarding grants HUD promotes the use of new low-cost approaches to hazard control that can be replicated across the nation.The Healthy Homes program enables HUD to assess and control housing-related hazards that contribute to childhood diseases and injuries. With funding from this program, grantees implement and evaluate methods for controlling two or more housing-related diseases through a single intervention. Healthy Homes funding is also used to provide technical support and training and assist in the completion of national surveys. In addition, the program conducts education and outreach to help State, local and non-governmental agencies, housing industry stakeholders, and the public understand the health and housing relationship and identify and address housing-related health and safety hazards.In addition, the Budget is proposing three new demonstrations. The Budget requests $35 million for the installation and replacement of carbon monoxide detectors in HUD-assisted housing. The Budget requests $5 million for radon testing and remediation in public housing. The Budget also requests $30 million for public housing agencies to conduct lead hazard screenings or risk assessments during housing quality inspections for Housing Choice Voucher units. The Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes will continue its lead-based paint technical studies and support activities, which include public education; support for State and local agencies, private property owners, HUD programs and field offices, and professional organizations; technical studies to improve program policy and implementation; quality control to ensure that the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards is done properly in HUD-assisted housing; and development of standards, technical guidance, regulations, and improved testing and hazard control methods."

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).","The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance for the purchase, refinance and rehabilitation of single-family homes. FHA mortgage insurance is designed to encourage lenders to make credit available to borrowers whom the conventional market does not adequately serve, including first-time homebuyers, minorities, lower-income families and residents of underserved areas (central cities and rural areas). Historically, FHA has also provided countercyclical support in times of economic crisis. For budgetary purposes, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund is separated into two risk categories: forward loans and Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). Forward programs guarantee loans for standard single-family purchases and refinances (Section 203(b) program), home improvements (Section 203(k) program) and condominiums. HECMs, also known as reverse mortgages, enable elderly homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes without having to make repayments during their lifetime. The 2021 Budget requests a limitation of $400 billion on loan guarantees for the MMI Fund. The Budget projects insurance of $200 billion in forward mortgages and $10.7 billion in HECMs, with additional commitment authority available in case these amounts are exceeded during execution. The Budget also requests $130 million in administrative expenses to support a range of FHA functions, including loan underwriting, claims processing and risk monitoring.  "

To focus efforts across the enterprise, the FBI developed strategic objectives, operational mission priorities, through its Integrated Program Management process.The FBI is headed by a Director, who is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. FBI Headquarters, located in Washington, DC, provides centralized operational, policy, and administrative support to FBI investigations. The FBI operates 56 field offices in major U.S. cities and 349 resident agencies (RAs) throughout the country. RAs are satellite offices that allow the FBI to maintain a presence in and serve local communities. The FBI also operates 63 Legal Attache offices and 28 sub-offices in 75 foreign countries around the world. Additionally, there are several specialized facilities and analytical centers within the FBI that are located across the country, such as the Criminal Justice Information Services Division in Clarksburg, WV; the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center and Hazardous Devices School in Huntsville, AL; and the FBI Academy and Laboratory at Quantico, VA.A number of FBI activities are carried out on a reimbursable basis. For example, the FBI is reimbursed for its participation in Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program, and by other Federal agencies for certain intelligence and investigative services, such as pre-employment background inquiries and fingerprint and name checks. The FBI is also authorized to conduct fingerprint and name checks for certain non-federal agencies.For 2021, the FBI is requesting a total of $9.749 billion.

The Budget incorporates the effects of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (Public Law 116-91) except for the effects on student loans.Funding from the Student Financial Assistance account and related matching funds would provide 7.4 million awards totaling more than $30.9 billion in available aid in award year 2021-2022.Federal Pell grants.--Pell Grants are the single largest source of grant aid for postsecondary education. Funding for this program is provided from two sources: discretionary and mandatory budget authority provided by the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, as amended, and changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965 made in the Department of Education Appropriations Act of 2019.In 2021, over 7.0 million undergraduates will receive up to $5,285 from the discretionary award and an additional $1,060 from the mandatory add-on to help pay for postsecondary education. Undergraduate students establish eligibility for these grants under award and need determination rules set out in the authorizing statute and annual appropriations act.The 2021 Budget request includes $22.5 billion in discretionary funding for Pell Grants in 2021, which, when combined with mandatory funding, will support a projected maximum award of $6,345. Federal work-study.--Federal funds are awarded by formula to qualifying institutions, which provide part-time jobs to eligible undergraduate and graduate students. Hourly earnings under this program must be at least the Federal minimum wage. Federal funding, in most cases, pays 75 percent of a student's hourly wages, with the remaining 25 percent paid by the employer. The Federal Work-Study program also requires participating institutions to use at least seven percent of their total funds for students employed in community service jobs.The 2021 Budget includes $500.0 million for Work-Study and proposes to reform the Federal Work-Study program to support workforce and career-oriented opportunities for low-income undergraduate students who can benefit the most, as opposed to subsidized employment for campus-based jobs through federal aid. The Budget also proposes to reform the institutional allocation formula in order to focus scarce funds, in part, on enrollment of Pell recipients.Iraq and Afghanistan service grants.--This program provides non-need-based grants to students whose parent or guardian was a member of the Armed Forces and died in Iraq or Afghanistan as a result of performing military service after September 11, 2001.Pooled Evaluation.--Requested authority in the General Provisions would enable the Department to reserve up to 0.5 percent of funding annually appropriated for certain Higher Education Act (HEA) programs for rigorous program evaluation, data collection, and analysis of outcome data. The authority would not allow the Department to reserve funds appropriated for Pell Grants, but would allow for evaluation of the program with the reserved funds.Funding tables.--The following tables display student aid funds available, the number of aid awards, average awards, and the unduplicated count of recipients from each Federal student aid program. Loan amounts reflect the amount actually loaned to borrowers, not the Federal cost of these loans. The data in these tables include matching funds wherever appropriate.

GI/SRI's mortgage insurance programs are designed to operate without the need for subsidy appropriations, with fees set higher than anticipated losses.

Libraries that have been designated as Federal depositories maintain these information products (as provided by GPO) as part of their existing collections and are responsible for assuring that the public has free access to the material provided by the FDLP.Included in this program is the maintenance and expansion of free, electronic access to information products produced by the Federal Government via govinfo. Electronic information dissemination and access have greatly expanded the number of publications offered to the Federal depository libraries as well as increasing public use of the FDLP content. As the FDLP continues its transition to a primarily electronic program, the costs of the program are increasingly related to identifying, acquiring, cataloging, linking to, authenticating, modernizing, and providing permanent public access to digital Government information.Cataloging and indexing.--The Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents are charged with preparing catalogs and indexes of all publications issued by the Federal Government that are not confidential in character. The principal publication is the web-based ""Catalog of U.S. Government Publications"" (CGP) (https://catalog.gpo.gov/). GPO's goal is to expand the CGP to a more comprehensive title listing of public documents, both historic and electronic, to increase the visibility and use of Government information products.International Exchange Service (IES).--Under the direction of the Library of Congress (LC), the Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents distributes tangible Government publications to foreign governments that agree to send the United States similar publications of their governments for LC collections."

The program began awarding grants in the 2008-2009 award year. Students must have a grade point average of 3.25 or higher to be eligible to receive a grant. Students who fail to fulfill the service requirements must repay the grants, including interest accrued from the time of award.Because TEACH Grants turn into loans in cases where the service requirements are not fulfilled, for budget and accounting purposes the program is operated consistent with the requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. This program account records subsidy costs reflecting the net present value of the estimated lifetime Federal program costs for grants awarded in a given fiscal year. Under this approach the subsidy cost reflects the cost of grant awards net of expected future repayments for grants that are converted to loans."

This interest subsidy reduces rents for lower income tenants. Some Section 236 properties also have rental assistance contracts with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) program.HUD has converted the last remaining Rent Supplement and RAP properties to long-term, project-based Section 8 contracts, using the Rental Assistance Demonstration program.

Projects supported by Title 17 loan guarantees must avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases; employ new or significantly improved technologies compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued; and offer a reasonable prospect of repayment of the principal and interest on the guaranteed obligation. Section 1703 of the Act authorizes DOE to provide loan guarantees for innovative energy projects in categories including renewable energy systems, advanced nuclear facilities, coal gasification, carbon sequestration, energy efficiency, and various other types of projects. The FY 2021 Budget maintains current Administration policy to eliminate this program, while maintaining portfolio monitoring capabilities. The FY 2021 Budget proposes to permanently cancel the approximate $161 million in remaining credit subsidy and all authority to guarantee loans appropriated in prior appropriations acts. In addition to $3,000,000 in appropriation offset by an estimated $3,000,000 in fee collections, LPO will utilize unobligated balances carried forward to cover loan portfolio monitoring and administrative expenses. In FY 2021, LPO will stop originating loans for the Title 17 Loan Guarantee Program but will continue to monitor the existing portfolio. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) amended the program's authorizing statute and provided $2.5 billion in emergency designated credit subsidy for a temporary program to support loan guarantees for commercial or advanced renewable energy systems, electric power transmission systems, and leading edge biofuel projects. Authority for the temporary program to extend new loans expired September 30, 2011. Prior to the expiration of the authority, DOE provided loan guarantees to 28 projects totaling over $16 billion in loan volume. Four projects withdrew prior to disbursement of any funds.

The Commission assists consumers in obtaining economically efficient, safe, reliable, and secure energy services at a reasonable cost through appropriate regulatory and market means, and collaborative efforts. Regulated entities pay fees and charges sufficient to recover the Commission's full cost of operations.Ensure Just and Reasonable Rates, Terms, and Conditions.--One of the Commission's fundamental statutory responsibilities is to ensure that rates, terms and conditions for wholesale sales and transmission of electric energy and natural gas in interstate commerce, as well as for transportation of oil by pipeline in interstate commerce, are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. To fulfill this responsibility, the Commission uses a combination of market and regulatory means, complemented by oversight and enforcement measures. The Commission carries out this responsibility by issuing orders and establishing rules and policies that continually balance two important interests: protecting energy consumers against excessive rates, and providing an opportunity for regulated entities to recover their costs and earn a reasonable return on their investments. For example, the Commission seeks to improve the competitiveness of organized wholesale electric markets, which in turn encourages entry of new resources, spurs innovation and deployment of new technologies, improves operating performance, and exerts downward pressure on costs. Another example of the Commission's use of market and regulatory means in support of this goal is found in the Commission's requirements for public utility transmission providers to participate in an open and transparent regional transmission planning process. In addition, the Commission approves cost-based, and where appropriate, market-based rates for the interstate transportation of natural gas and oil on jurisdictional pipelines, and for the interstate transmission, and wholesale sales of electric energy. The Commission also reviews proposed mergers and other transactions in the electric industry to ensure that these proposals will not harm the public interest.Oversight, surveillance and enforcement are essential complements to the Commission's approach to ensure that rates, terms and conditions of service are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The Commission conducts compliance audits, issues publicly available audit reports, and engages in formal and informal outreach efforts to promote effective compliance programs. Audits are planned and prioritized using a risk-based approach in order to maximize the impact of the Commission's resources. The Commission also conducts public and non-public investigations of possible violations of the statutes, regulations, rules, orders, and tariffs administered by the Commission. These investigations often rely upon oversight and surveillance that employ sophisticated technology to monitor market behavior. When violations of sufficient seriousness are discovered, the Commission attempts to resolve the resulting investigation through settlement with appropriate sanctions and future compliance improvements before initiating further enforcement proceedings.Promote Safe, Reliable, and Secure Infrastructure.--The Commission plays an important role in the development of energy infrastructure that operates safely and reliably. One aspect of the Commission's role in energy infrastructure development stems from siting authority that includes licensing non-Federal hydropower projects, certificating interstate natural gas pipelines and storage projects, authorizing liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, and, in certain circumstances, permitting electric transmission lines. With the rising demand for natural gas and hydropower comes increased infrastructure construction, making it all the more important that FERC oversee the private sector development of safe, reliable, and secure infrastructure in a way that fosters economic and environmental benefits for the nation. The Commission reviews applications to construct, operate, or modify natural gas and hydropower infrastructure by ensuring that facilities are constructed and operated in compliance with the conditions of FERC orders. The Commission must respond to energy infrastructure applications with timely and well-reasoned decisions that balance a range of factors such as competing interests, legal requirements, and environmental impacts. The Commission encourages, and sometimes requires, project proponents to engage in early involvement with state and Federal agencies, Indian tribes, affected landowners and the public. The Commission's request provides continued funding for program contracts associated with statutorily required workload associated with hydropower and natural gas infrastructure, including environmental reviews, stakeholder engagement, and construction oversight. The Commission also has an important role in ensuring that energy infrastructure, once authorized, continues to operate safely and reliably. FERC conducts timely safety reviews and inspections with rigorous requirements, thereby advancing the safety of non-federal hydropower projects and LNG facilities throughout their entire life cycle. The Commission relies on physical inspections for detecting and preventing potential catastrophic structural failures. In regards to jurisdictional LNG facilities, the Commission conducts construction and operational inspections to ensure that the facilities are constructed and operated in accordance with the conditions of Commission Orders, including safety measures and plans. Inspections at both types of facilities protect the public against the risks associated with incidents at the facilities. The 2021 request includes increased funding to advance the Commission's Part 12 inspection program and reviews of operational LNG facilities.The Commission also oversees the development and review of mandatory reliability and security standards for the bulk-power system, as well as compliance with these standards. FERC promotes the reliable operation of the bulk-power system through oversight of the electric reliability organization (ERO). A Commission-certified ERO develops and enforces mandatory Reliability Standards, subject to the Commission's oversight and approval. The Reliability Standards address the planning and operation, as well as the cyber security and physical protection of the Nation's electric transmission grid. The Commission may also, upon its own motion or upon complaint, order the ERO to submit a proposed reliability standard or a modification of an existing reliability standard that addresses a specific reliability matter. To that end, the Commission incorporates performance data-driven, risk-informed decision making into its reliability oversight. In addition, FERC provides leadership, expertise, and assistance in identifying, communicating and developing comprehensive solutions to cyber and physical security risks to FERC-jurisdictional infrastructure. This is achieved through collaboration with federal and jurisdictional entities to identify, inform, assess, and address cyber and physical security threats and vulnerabilities, and to promote voluntary best practices that provide an important complement to FERC's related responsibilities for both regulatory requirements and enforcement. The Commission engages with the owners and operators of key critical infrastructure facilities to identify and share threat information, analyze system vulnerabilities, and assist with effective mitigation.Mission Support through Organizational Excellence.--The public interest is best served when the Commission operates in an efficient, responsive and transparent manner. The Commission pursues this goal by maintaining processes and providing services in accordance with governing statutes, authoritative guidance, and prevailing best practices. These processes and services help prioritize resource allocations, make prudent investments that yield returns that directly benefit the agency's mission and use Commission resources in an efficient manner. The Commission also provides services, tools, and resources to equip employees to drive success and accomplish the agency's mission.The Commission thus makes continued investments in its human capital, information technology (IT) resources, and physical infrastructure. The Commission allocates sixty-seven percent of its budget to directly cover the compensation costs of its employees on an annual basis. The Commission continues to focus its human capital efforts on the competencies and positions most affected by the challenges of new and emerging knowledge/skill demands and the loss of institutional knowledge. The Commission's overall IT infrastructure must meet the demands and keep pace with the continual changes in the technology landscape; proactively monitor and mitigate emerging cybersecurity threats; and adhere to federal requirements. In 2021, the Commission will make additional investments to continue its multi-year effort to update and modernize the Commission's information technology infrastructure and core mission and support systems to maintain a secure and reliable IT infrastructure to meet the needs of the Commission and provide innovative solutions to support employees. The Commission is also undergoing a multi-year renovation effort within its headquarters building. The renovation project will enable the agency to realize significant space savings. The FY 2021 request includes approximately $9.1 million to cover construction costs to continue the modernization effort.Facilitating understanding of how the Commission carries out its responsibilities and maintaining public trust in the Commission are important components of the Commission's commitment to organizational excellence. Trust and understanding increase acceptance of Commission decisions. The Commission achieves this by maintaining processes and public information services that promote transparency and open communication with respect to the conduct of the Commission's business. Through the use of the Commission's eLibrary and eSubscriptions web pages, the public can obtain extensive information concerning documents both submitted to and issued by the Commission. The Commission also manages several social media sites to promote transparency and open communication."

The strategy to accomplish this has three thrusts: developing, deploying, and maintaining world-class computing and network facilities for science; advancing research in applied mathematics, computer science and advanced networking; and partnering with other DOE and Office of Science (SC) programs to advance the use of its high performance computers to drive scientific advances for the Nation. The program supports the development, maintenance, and operation of large high-performance computing and network facilities, including the Leadership Computing Facilities at Oak Ridge and Argonne National Laboratories, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Energy Sciences Network.Maximizing the benefits of U.S. leadership computing in the coming decades will require an effective national response to increasing demands for computing capabilities and performance, emerging technological challenges and opportunities, and competition with other nations. The DOE has a long history of making fundamental contributions to applied mathematics and computer science associated with strategic computing and a similar set of contributions is foreseen for quantum computing and networking, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) in the science domain and in related investments in advanced architectures and hardware. ASCR's proposed activities are in line with the Nation's Research and Development (R&amp;D) priority for American Leadership in AI, Quantum Information Sciences (QIS), and Strategic Computing. Within the context of this coordinated Federal strategy, the SC and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) continue to partner on the Department's Exascale Computing Initiative (ECI) to overcome key exascale challenges in parallelism, energy efficiency, and reliability, leading to deployment of a diverse set of exascale systems in the calendar year 2021-2022 timeframe. The ECI's goal for an exascale-capable system is a five-fold increase in sustained performance over the Summit high-performance computing (HPC) system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with applications that address next-generation science, engineering, and data problems. The ECI focuses on delivering advanced simulation through an exascale-capable computing program, emphasizing sustained performance in science and national security mission applications and increased convergence between exascale and large-data analytic computing.Basic Energy Sciences.--The Basic Energy Sciences (BES) program supports fundamental research to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy at the electronic, atomic, and molecular levels in order to provide the foundations for new energy technologies and to support DOE missions in energy, environment, and national security. Key to exploiting such discoveries is the ability to create new materials using sophisticated synthesis and processing techniques, precisely define the atomic arrangements in matter, and control physical and chemical transformations. The energy systems of the future will revolve around materials and chemical changes that convert energy from one form to another. The research disciplines that BES supports--condensed matter and materials physics, chemistry, geosciences, and aspects of biosciences--are those that discover new materials and design new chemical processes that touch virtually every important aspect of energy resources, production, conversion, transmission, storage, efficiency, and waste mitigation. BES research provides a knowledge base to help understand, predict, and ultimately control the natural world and helps build the foundation for achieving a secure and sustainable energy future.  BES invests in fundamental research to drive the scientific frontiers and innovation in high priority areas such as QIS, AI/ML, microelectronics, polymer upcycling, critical materials and rare earth separations, and exascale computing. BES also manages a research portfolio in accelerator physics, x-ray and neutron detectors, and x-ray-optics to explore technology options for developing the next generations of x-ray and neutron sources. BES also supports twelve world-class, open-access scientific user facilities consisting of a complementary set of intense x-ray sources, neutron sources, and research centers for nanoscale science. BES facilities probe materials with ultrahigh spatial, temporal, and energy resolutions to investigate the critical functions of matter--transport, reactivity, fields, excitations, and motion--and answer some of the most challenging grand science questions. These facilities undergo continual development and upgrade of capabilities, including fabricating new x-ray and neutron experimental stations, improving core facilities, and providing new stand-alone instruments and capabilities. BES also manages construction projects to build new or upgrade existing facilities to provide world-leading tools and instruments to the scientific community and maintain U.S. leadership in the physical sciences. Biological and Environmental Research.--The Biological and Environmental Research (BER) program supports fundamental research and provides scientific user facilities to achieve a predictive understanding of complex biological, earth, and environmental systems for energy and infrastructure resilience and sustainability. The program seeks to understand the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles needed to predict a continuum of processes from the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to environmental and ecological processes. Starting with the genetic potential encoded by organisms' genomes, BER Biological System Science research approaches include genome sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, structural biology, high-resolution imaging and characterization, and integration of information into predictive computational models that can be iteratively tested and validated. This can enable more confident redesign of microbes and plants for sustainable biofuels production, improved carbon storage, and controlled biological transformation of materials such as nutrients and metals in the environment. The program also is initiating new efforts in translating biodesign rules to functional properties of novel biological polymers. BER Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences research advances the fundamental scientific analysis and modeling of the sensitivity and uncertainty of earth system predictions to atmospheric, cryospheric, oceanic, and biogeochemical processes in both terrestrial and subsurface environments. Investments will continue to support the E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) capability, tailored to DOE requirements for a variety of scenarios applied to spatial scales as small as 10 kilometers. The DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) provides high quality genome sequence data and analysis techniques for a wide variety of plants and microbial communitiesin support of sustainable, renewable bioenergy and bioproducts research, and environmental research. JGI continues to be an essential component of DOE systems biology efforts. The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) research facility provides unique, multi-instrumented capabilities for continuous, long-term observations of clouds, aerosols, and related meteorological information that can be used to improve earth system models. The Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) provides integrated experimental and computational resources for discovery and technological innovation in the environmental molecular sciences.Fusion Energy Sciences.--The Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program mission is to expand the fundamental understanding of matter at very high temperatures and densities and to build the scientific foundation needed to develop a fusion energy source. This is accomplished through the study of plasma, the fourth state of matter, and how it interacts with its surroundings. Plasma science is wide-ranging, since 99 percent of the visible universe is composed of plasmas of various types. High-temperature fusion plasmas at hundreds of millions of degrees occur in national security applications albeit for very short times. The same fusion plasmas may be exploited in the laboratory in controlled fashion to become the basis for a future clean nuclear power source, which could provide domestic energy independence and security.The FES program has three elements: 1) Burning Plasma Science: Foundations--The behavior of magnetically confined fusion plasmas is experimentally explored on the DIII-D National Fusion Facility and the National Spherical Torus Experiment-Upgrade, which are national SC user facilities. Fusion theory and simulation activities predict and interpret the complex behavior of plasmas as self-organized systems. The element supports FES Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing centers in partnership with ASCR; 2) Burning Plasma Science: Long Pulse--U.S. scientists take advantage of international partnerships to conduct research on superconducting tokamaks and stellarators with long-duration capabilities. The element supports research to develop novel materials that can withstand the extreme fusion environment; 3) Discovery Plasma Science: Research--This elment supports research on areas including plasma astrophysics, high-energy-density laboratory plasmas, low-temperature plasmas, and innovative measurement techniques. Investments in transformational technologies such as machine learning, QIS, microelectronics, and high-performance strategic computing accelerate progress in several mission areas. Finally, the unique scientific challenges and rigor of fusion and plasma physics research lead to the development of a well-trained Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics-focused workforce, which will contribute to maintaining and advancing U.S. competitiveness and world-leadership in key areas of future technological and economic importance, as well as national security.High Energy Physics.--The High Energy Physics (HEP) program mission is to understand how the universe works at its most fundamental level by discovering the elementary constituents of matter and energy, probing the interactions among them, and exploring the basic nature of space and time. The HEP program offers research opportunities for individual investigators and small-scale collaborations, as well as very large international collaborations. A world-wide program of particle physics research is underway to discover what lies beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Five intertwined science drivers of particle physics provide compelling lines of inquiry that show great promise for discovery: use the Higgs boson as a new tool for discovery; pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass; identify the new physics of dark matter; understand cosmic acceleration, dark energy, and inflation; and explore new particles, interactions and physical principles. The program enables scientific discovery through a strategy organized along three frontiers of particle physics: 1) The Energy Frontier, where researchers accelerate particles to the highest energies ever made by humans and collide them to produce and study the fundamental constituents of matter. This requires some of the largest machines ever built; 2) The Intensity Frontier, where researchers use a combination of intense particle beams and highly sensitive detectors to make extremely precise measurements of particle properties, to study some of the rarest particle interactions predicted by the Standard Model , and to search for new physics; and 3) The Cosmic Frontier, where researchers seek to reveal the nature of dark matter and dark energy by using naturally occurring particles to explore new phenomena. The highest-energy particles ever observed have come from cosmic sources, and the ancient light from distant galaxies allows scientists to map the distribution of dark matter and perhaps unravel the nature of dark energy. Investments in Theoretical, Computational, and Interdiciplinary Physics provide the framework to explain experimental observations and gain a deeper understanding of nature while addressing cross-cutting challenges in QIS and AI/ML. Advanced Technology R&amp;D fosters fundamental research into particle acceleration and detection techniques and instrumentation, supporting the frontiers and enabling future discovery experiments.  Accelerator Stewardship supports R&amp;D for advanced technologies and research tools synergistic with HEP that directly impact other sciences,industry, medicine, and national security.Nuclear Physics.--The Nuclear Physics (NP) program mission is to discover, explore, and understand all forms of nuclear matter. Although the fundamental particles that compose nuclear matter--quarks and gluons--are themselves relatively well understood, exactly how they interact and combine to form the different types of matter observed in the universe today and during its evolution remains largely unknown. Nuclear physicists seek to understand not just the familiar forms of matter we see around us, but also exotic forms such as those which existed in the first microseconds after the birth of the cosmos and that exist today inside neutron stars. The NP program addresses three tightly interrelated scientific thrusts: 1) how the strong nuclear force assembles quarks and gluons into protons and neutrons; 2) how novel forms of bulk, strongly interacting matter behave, such as the quark-gluon plasma that formed in the early universe; and 3) the structure of nuclei; how protons and neutrons combine to form atomic nuclei and how these nuclei have arisen during the 13.8 billion years since the birth of the cosmos. NP provides approximately 95 percent of all nuclear science federal research funding. NP supports highly trained university and national laboratory scientists to conceive, plan, execute, and interpret transformative experiments in the U.S. and in international collaborations. NP also maintains and operates three national scientific user facilities that accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light, producing short-lived forms of matter for investigation. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams is nearing completion at Michigan State University, and will provide advanced world-leading capabilities for science, national security applications, and isotope production. Researchers will use NP's low energy, precision nuclear experiments, many enabled by new quantum sensors, to search for a deeper understanding of nuclear interactions. The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) will ensure U.S. leadership in nuclear physics research and accelerator R&amp;D. The EIC will enable scientists to investigate and answer questions about the basic building blocks of nuclei and how quarks and gluons (particles inside neutrons and protons), interact dynamically via the strong force to generate the fundamental properties of neutrons and protons, such as mass and spin.  The DOE Isotope Program supports high-priority research on the development of cutting-edge approaches for producing isotopes critical to the nation in basic research and applications, including ground breaking research on the production of alpha emitting isotopes in sufficient quantity to enable clinical trials for cancer therapy.  The program provides mission readiness for the production of radioactive and stable isotopes that are in short supply for research and a wide array of applications. Construction continues for the Stable Isotope Production and Research Center to expand the stable isotope production capability to meet the demand of the Nation, while also mitigating dependency on critical isotopes from foreign suppliers.  Stable and radioactive isotopes are vital to the missions of many Federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Homeland Security, NNSA, and DOE SC programs. NP continues to work in close collaboration with all federal organizations to develop strategic plans for isotope production and to establish effective communication to better forecast isotope needs and leverage resources.Science Laboratories Infrastructure.--The Science Laboratories Infrastructure (SLI) program supports scientific and technological innovation at the SC laboratories by funding and sustaining mission-ready infrastructure and fostering safe and environmentally responsible operations. The program provides state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure that are flexible, reliable, and sustainable in support of scientific discovery. The SLI program also funds Payments in Lieu of Taxes to local communities around the Argonne, Brookhaven, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The SLI program continues to focus on improving infrastructure across the SC national laboratory complex. The FY 2021 Budget includes funding for three new construction starts and fifteen on-going SLI construction projects.Safeguards and Security.--The Safeguards and Security (S&amp;S) program is designed to ensure appropriate security measures are in place to support the SC mission requirement of open scientific research and to protect critical assets within SC laboratories. This is accomplished by providing physical controls that will mitigate possible risks to the laboratories' employees, nuclear and special materials, classified and sensitive information, and facilities. The S&amp;S program also provides funding for cyber security for the laboratories' information technology systems to protect electronic data while enabling the SC mission.Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists.--The Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists (WDTS) program mission is to help ensure that DOE has a sustained pipeline of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workers. This is accomplished through support of undergraduate internships, and graduate thesis research at the DOE laboratories; and annual, nationwide, middle- and high-school science competitions culminating in the National Science Bowl in Washington, D.C. These investments help develop the next generation of scientists and engineers to support the DOE mission, administer programs, and conduct research.Program Direction.--Science Program Direction supports a highly skilled Federal workforce to develop and oversee SC investments in research and scientific user facilities. SC investments deliver scientific discoveries and major scientific tools that transform our understanding of nature and advance the energy, economic, and national security of the United States. In addition, SC provides public access to DOE scientific findings to further leverage the Federal science investment and advance the scientific enterprise. SC requires highly skilled scientific and technical program and project managers, as well as experts in areas such as acquisition, finance, legal, construction, and infrastructure management, human resources, and environmental, safety, and health oversight. SC plans, executes, and manages basic science research programs that address critical national needs. Oversight of DOE's basic research portfolio, which includes extramural grants and contracts supporting over 23,000 researchers located at over 300 institutions and the 17 DOE national laboratories, spanning all fifty states and the District of Columbia and 28 scientific user facilities serving over 33,000 users per year, as well as supervision of major construction projects, is a Federal responsibility."

This narrative outlines the structure of these two programs and provides text tables displaying program cost data; loan volume, subsidy, default, and interest rates; and other descriptive information. From its inception in 1965 through the end of June 2010, the FFEL program guaranteed almost $899 billion in loans made to postsecondary students and their parents. Although no new FFEL loans have been originated since July 1, 2010, $174 billion of outstanding FFEL loans continue to be serviced by lenders, the Department of Education, and guaranty agencies. The 2021 Budget proposes to eliminate the payment of Account Maintenance Fees to guaranty agencies.Under the Direct Loan program, the Federal Government provides loan capital through the Treasury while the Department of Education loan origination and servicing is handled by private and not-for-profit loan servicers under performance-based contracts with the Department. The Direct Loan program began operation in award year 1994-1995, originating 7 percent of overall loan volume. In 2021, excluding Consolidation Loans, the Direct Loan program will make $93.8 billion in new loans.The Direct Loan program currently offers four types of loans: Subsidized Stafford; Unsubsidized Stafford; PLUS; and Consolidation. Loans can be used for qualified educational expenses. Undergraduates with financial need may receive a Subsidized Stafford loan (graduate and professional students are not eligible). The other three loan programs are available to borrowers at all income levels. Interest rates are set annually for loans originated in the upcoming award year based on the 10-year Treasury note; those rates will remain fixed for the life of the loan. For Subsidized Stafford loans available to undergraduates, the interest rate will be equal to the 10-year Treasury note plus 2.05 percent and capped at 8.25 percent. Loans originated in award year 2019-2020 have an interest rate of 4.53 percent. Interest payments for these loans are fully subsidized by the Federal Government while a student is in school (up to 150 percent of program length) and during grace and deferment periods. The interest rate on new Unsubsidized Stafford loans for undergraduate borrowers is the same as that on Subsidized Stafford loans for undergraduates. The Unsubsidized Stafford loan interest rate for graduate and professional students is equal to the 10-year Treasury note plus 3.6 percent and capped at 9.5 percent. Loans originated in award year 2019-2020 have an interest rate of 6.08 percent. The borrower interest rate on PLUS loans to graduate and professional students and parents of undergraduate borrowers is equal to the 10-year Treasury note plus 4.6 percent and capped at 10.5 percent. PLUS loans originated in award year 2019-2020 have an interest rate of 7.08 percent.Consolidation loans allow borrowers to combine FFEL, Direct Loans, and Perkins Loans, as well as some loans made under the Public Health Service Act. The interest rate for new Consolidation loans equals the weighted average of the interest rate on the loans consolidated, rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of a percent. For most types of Direct Loans, the origination fee is a base rate of 1 percent, but an additional surcharge for sequestration was added in years 2013 to 2020. The base origination fee for PLUS loans is 4 percent, but has included an additional surcharge in years 2013 to 2020. Borrowers may choose from four basic types of repayment plans: standard; graduated; extended (available for qualified borrowers who have outstanding loans of more than $30,000); and income-driven. FFEL borrowers may change repayment plans annually. Direct Loan borrowers may switch between repayment plans at any time. The maximum repayment period is 10 years for standard and graduated plans, as well as the income-sensitive repayment plan that is available only for FFEL loans. Under the current income-driven administrative Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and statutory Income-Based-Repayment (IBR) plans, for new borrowers after 2014, the repayment period is 20 years. Under the current income-driven administrative REPAYE plan, the repayment period is 20 or 25 years depending on whether the borrower has any graduate school loans. And, under the extended, former IBR (for borrowers prior to 2014), and income-contingent repayment plans, the maximum time is 25 years. PAYE and IBR require partial financial hardship in order to qualify for reduced payments and borrowers in those plans have their monthly payments capped at the monthly payment of the 10-year Standard plan. At the end of the repayment term, the borrower's remaining balance is forgiven.Federal student loans have other benefits. For example, Federal student loans can be discharged when borrowers die, become totally and permanently disabled, or, under some circumstances, declare bankruptcy. In addition, there are several loan forgiveness programs. For example, new borrowers after October 1, 1998, who are employed as teachers in schools serving low-income populations for 5 consecutive, complete school years, qualify for up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness; this benefit is increased to $17,500 for mathematics, science, and special education teachers considered highly qualified under criteria established in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In addition, under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, qualifying borrowers who have worked for 10 years full-time for an eligible public service employer, and made 120 qualifying monthly payments after October 1, 2007 in the standard or income-driven plans can have any remaining loan balance forgiven. This benefit is only available in the Direct Loan program, though FFEL borrowers may receive the benefit by taking out a Direct Consolidation Loan. Forgiveness is available for all Direct Loan borrowers, regardless of when they took out their loans. The 2021 Budget institutes sensible annual and lifetime loan limits for graduate and parent borrowers.  The 2021 Budget proposes to set an aggregate limit on Parent PLUS loans for undergraduate students of $26,500, the difference between the dependent undergraduate aggregate limit of $31,000 and the independent undergraduate aggregate limit of $57,500. In addition, dependent undergraduate students would be eligible to borrow an additional amount (up to the independent undergraduate limit) depending on the parents eligibility for additional borrowing. The Budget also proposes to set annual and aggregate limits of $50,000 and $100,000 respectively for graduate students, exclusive of any undergraduate borrowing. Graduate student borrowing would additionally be simplified by consolidating all graduate borrowing under one graduate loan program with the same corresponding loan terms and conditions as current Graduate PLUS loans. In addition, the 2021 Budget provides higher education institutions greater flexibility to ensure their students avoid excessive student loan debt and are able to repay their loans. As such, the Request proposes to provide financial aid administrators greater latitude to limit loan borrowing and proposes schools be allowed to impose mandatory annual financial literacy training (i.e., loan counseling) in order for students to receive loan disbursements.The 2021 Budget would replace the five current Income Driven repayment (IDR) plans with one new Single IDR plan to make choosing a repayment plan less complex. The new IDR plan would become the only income-driven repayment plan for borrowers who originate their first loan on or after July 1, 2021, with an exception for students who borrowed their first loans prior to July 1, 2021 and who are borrowing to complete their current course of study. The Single IDR plan would: cap payments at 12.5 percent of discretionary monthly income while eliminating the standard repayment cap; limit loan payments to 15 years for borrowers with undergraduate debt only and 30 years for borrowers with any graduate debt--any remaining amounts owed after these repayment periods would be forgiven; calculate payments for married borrowers filing separately on the combined household Adjusted Gross Income; and eliminate Public Service Loan Forgiveness. As with the Single IDR plan, these policies would apply to loans originated on or after July 1, 2021, with an exception for students continuing to borrow to complete their current course of study.To further improve the implementation and effectiveness of IDR, the Budget proposes auto-enrolling severely delinquent borrowers into the Single IDR plan.  The 2021 Budget would also eliminate Subsidized Stafford loans. As with the Single IDR plan, this policy would apply to loans originated on or after July 1, 2021, with an exception for students continuing to borrow to complete their current course of study. The 2021 Budget incorporates the effects of the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education Act (Public Law 116-91) except for the effects on student loans.The following tables display performance indicators and program data, including projected overall Direct Loan and FFEL costs.

The cleanup strategy follows a risk-informed approach that focuses first on those soil and groundwater contaminant plumes and sources that are the greatest contributors to risk. The overall goal is first to ensure that risks to the public and workers are controlled, then to clean up soil and groundwater using a risk-informed methodology. NNSA is responsible for long-term stewardship of its sites after physical cleanup is completed. Los Alamos legacy cleanup is managed by the EM Los Alamos field office. Funding is included to support the deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) of specific high-risk excess facilities to be transferred to the Environmental Management program for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.Oak Ridge.--Funds defense-related cleanup of the three facilities that make up the Oak Ridge Reservation: the East Tennessee Technology Park, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the Y-12 Plant. The overall cleanup strategy is based on surface water considerations, encompassing five distinct watersheds that feed the adjacent Clinch River.Savannah River Site.--Funds the safe stabilization, treatment, and disposition of legacy nuclear materials, spent nuclear fuel, and waste at the Savannah River site. Key activities include operating the Defense Waste Processing Facility, which is solidifying the high activity liquid waste contained in underground storage tanks, and the testing and cold commissioning of the Salt Waste Processing Facility, which will separate various tank waste components and treat and dispose the low activity liquid waste stream.Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.--Funds the world's first permitted deep geologic repository for the permanent disposal of radioactive waste, and the Nation's only disposal site for defense-generated transuranic waste. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, managed by the Carlsbad Field Office, is an operating facility, supporting the disposal of transuranic waste from waste generator and storage sites across the DOE complex. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is crucial to the Department of Energy (DOE) completing its cleanup and closure mission.Program Direction.--Funds the Federal workforce responsible for the overall direction and administrative support of the EM program, including both Headquarters and field personnel.Program Support.--Funds management and direction for various crosscutting EM and DOE initiatives, intergovernmental activities, and analyses and integration activities across DOE in a consistent, responsible, and efficient manner.Safeguards and Security.--Funds activities to protect against unauthorized access, theft, diversion, loss of custody or destruction of DOE assets, and hostile acts that could cause adverse impacts to fundamental national security or the health and safety of DOE and contractor employees, the public or the environment.Technology Development and Deployment.--Funds projects managed through Headquarters to address the immediate, near- and long-term technology needs identified by the EM sites, enabling them to accelerate their cleanup schedules, treat orphaned wastes, improve worker safety, and provide technical foundations for the sites' cleanup decisions.

The Act, as amended, is codified in part at 38 U.S.C. 7251-7299. The Court is located in Washington, D.C., but as a national court may sit anywhere in the United States.The Court is part of the Federal judicial system and has a permanent authorization for seven judges, one of whom serves as chief judge. Per Public Law 114-315, the Congress temporarily authorized expansion of the Court to nine active judges. Judges are appointed by the President, and with the advice and consent of the Senate, for 15-year terms. The Court is currently staffed with seven active judges, since two judges retired in December 2019. Upon retirement, a judge may choose to be recall eligible, and thus willing to be recalled to service by the chief judge. Currently eight of the Court's ten retired judges are recall eligible and are recalled to service on a rotational basis. Recall-eligible judges may elect full retirement at any time.The Court has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions made by the Department of Veterans Affairs Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) that adversely affect a person's entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. This judicial review, although specialized in scope, is the same as that performed by all other United States Courts of Appeals. In cases before it, the Court has the authority to decide all relevant questions of law; to interpret constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions; and to determine the meaning or applicability of actions/decisions by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Court may affirm, set aside, reverse, or remand those decisions as appropriate. Additionally, the Court has class action authority, has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1651 to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction, and may act on applications under 28 U.S.C. 2412(d), the Equal Access to Justice Act. Certain decisions by the Court are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and, if certiorari is granted, by the Supreme Court of the United States. For management, administration, and expenditure of funds in areas beyond the bounds of Chapter 72 of Title 38, the Court may exercise the authorities provided for such purposes applicable to other courts as defined in Title 28, U.S. Code.In 1992, the Congress authorized the Court to transfer funds from its appropriation that year to the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), for the purpose of providing, facilitating, and furnishing legal and other assistance, through grant or contract, to veterans and others seeking recourse in the Court. That program, often referred to as the pro bono representation program, has been ongoing since that time, with LSC responsible for oversight and grant distribution responsibilities. The Appropriations Subcommittees consider LSC's budget request separately from the Court's budget request, although both are submitted together."

Government's largest income-targeted rental assistance program. With this funding, the Housing Choice Voucher program will provide housing assistance to around 1.9 million extremely low- to very low-income families to rent decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. About 2,200 state and local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) administer the Housing Choice Voucher program.The Budget provides $16.9 billion in contract renewals to continue to assist families in calendar year 2021. The Budget also includes $310 million for the renewal of Section 811 mainstream housing vouchers for persons with disabilities, including the first-time renewal of new mainstream vouchers allocated in 2020, and associated administrative fees, as well as a new set-aside to provide adjustments to PHAs as a result of significant increases in mainstream renewal costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances and to prevent the termination of assistance for mainstream families should there be insufficient funding.In addition, the Budget requests the following: $1.5 billion in PHA administrative fees to support core functions such as admitting households, conducting housing quality inspections, and completing tenant income certifications; $100 million for tenant protection vouchers, which are provided to families who may have to relocate due to actions beyond their control, such as a public housing demolition or redevelopment, and when private owners of multi-family developments choose to leave the project-based program or convert to long-term Section 8 contracts; and up to $4 million for the renewal of vouchers by tribes under the Tribal Housing and Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, to serve Native American veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and living in and around designated tribal areas. The Budget also reflects that PHAs with the Moving to Work (MTW) designation will be receiving funds from the MTW account, instead of the TBRA and Public Housing accounts. The separate MTW account includes $4.5 billion for MTW agencies' contract renewals and administrative fees. Further, the Budget continues to support legislative reforms as reflected in the Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 and uniform work requirements."

Southwestern operates and maintains 1,380 miles of high voltage transmission lines, 26 substations/switching stations, associated power system controls, and communication sites. Southwestern also makes modifications and constructs additions to existing facilities.Southwestern markets and delivers its power at wholesale rates primarily to public bodies and rural electric cooperatives. In compliance with statutory requirements, Southwestern's power sales contracts provide for periodic rate adjustments to ensure that the Federal Government recovers all costs of operations, other costs allocated to power, and the capital investments in power facilities, with interest. Southwestern is also responsible for scheduling and dispatching power and negotiating power sales contracts to meet changing customer load requirements. As in past years, the budget continues to provide funding for annual expenses and purchase power and wheeling expenses through discretionary offsetting collections derived from power receipts collected to recover those expenses.Program Direction.--Provides compensation and all related expenses for personnel who market, deliver, operate, and maintain Southwestern's high-voltage interconnected power system and associated facilities, those that perform cyber and physical security roles, and those that administratively support these functions.Operations and Maintenance.--Provides essential electrical and communications equipment replacements and upgrades, capitalized moveable equipment, technical services, and supplies and materials necessary for the safe, reliable, and cost effective operation and maintenance of the power system.Purchase Power and Wheeling.--Provides for the purchase and delivery of energy to meet limited peaking power contractual obligations. Federal power receipts and alternative financing methods, including net billing, bill crediting, and customer advances are used to fund system-purchased power support and other contractual services. Southwestern has implemented a Purchase Power and Wheeling (PPW) risk mitigation strategy to ensure continuous operations during periods of significant drought. The strategy was developed consistent with existing authorities, and with the participation and support of Southwestern's power customers. Under this approach, Southwestern retains receipts from the recovery of purchase power and wheeling expenses within the 'up to' amount specified by Congress. The receipts retained are available until expended and are available only for PPW expenses. As of the end of FY 2019, Southwestern's PPW reserve balance was $86 million. Customers will provide other power resources and/or purchases for the remainder of their firm loads.DISCRETIONARY PURCHASE POWER AND WHEELING, SOUTHWESTERN POWER ADMINISTRATION(in millions of dollars) 2017 Actual2018 Actual2019 Actual2020 Estimate12021 Estimate1Limitation to collect, ('up to' ceiling in appropriations language)7340504370Actual collections1740364370PPW Unobligated balance brought forward, Oct 18385698686Spending authority from offsetting collections1740364370Obligations incurred-15-56-19-43-70PPW Unobligated balance, end of year85698686861The FY 2020 and FY 2021 Estimates assume spending authority from offsetting collections equals the 'up to' ceiling and that obligations incurred are the same amount as the spending authority.

These two programs provide policy and technical leadership to prevent or limit the spread of materials, technology, and expertise related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD); develop technologies that detect the proliferation of WMD worldwide; secure or eliminate inventories of nuclear weapons-related materials and infrastructure; and ensure a technically trained response both domestically and worldwide to nuclear and radiological incidents.The major elements of the appropriation account include the following:Material Management and Minimization (M3).--M3 programs minimize and, when possible, eliminate weapons-usable nuclear material around the world to achieve permanent threat reduction. This includes minimizing the civilian use of highly enriched uranium (HEU); removing or eliminating the world's most vulnerable weapons-usable nuclear material; and disposing of excess nuclear material in the United States.Global Material Security (GMS).--GMS programs prevent terrorists and other actors from obtaining nuclear and radiological material to use in an improvised nuclear device or a radiological dispersal device by working with partner countries to improve the security of vulnerable materials and facilities and to improve partners' capacities to deter, detect, and investigate illicit trafficking of these materials. GMS works with countries in bilateral partnerships, and with and through multilateral partners such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol).Nonproliferation and Arms Control (NPAC).--NPAC supports activities to prevent the proliferation of WMD by state and non-state actors. NPAC develops and implements programs and strategies to strengthen international nuclear safeguards; control the spread of nuclear and dual-use material, equipment, technology, and expertise; verify nuclear reductions and compliance with nonproliferation and arms control treaties and agreements; and address enduring and emerging nonproliferation and arms control challenges and opportunities.National Technical Nuclear Forensics (NTNF).--NNSA will focus on expanding nuclear forensics capabilities in both research and development (R&amp;D) and operations leveraging existing capabilities in the DNN and Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation offices.Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development (DNN R&amp;D).--DNN R&amp;D drives the innovation of unilateral and multi-lateral technical capabilities to detect nuclear detonations; foreign nuclear weapons programs' activities; and the presence, movement, or diversion of special nuclear materials. To meet national and Departmental nuclear security requirements, DNN R&amp;D leverages the unique facilities and scientific skills of the Department of Energy, academia, and industry to perform research, conduct technology demonstrations, develop prototypes, and produce and deliver sensors for integration into operational systems.Nonproliferation Construction.--The budget supports the transition to the dilute and dispose strategy to fulfill the United States' commitment to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus U.S. weapon-grade plutonium and remove plutonium from the state of South Carolina. The request supports the continuation of preliminary design for the Surplus Plutonium Disposition (SPD) project, as well as long-lead procurements. With available prior year balances, termination activities for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication project will be completed in FY 2021. Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR).--The NCTIR Program executes the DOE/NNSA's Comprehensive Emergency Management System program that administers implementation and support of emergency management for all DOE/NNSA offices and sites, and manages the DOE/NNSA Consolidated Emergency Operations Center, Emergency Communications Network, Emergency Management Policy, Training, National Exercises Program, and Continuity Program activities. NCTIR also applies the unique technical expertise from NNSA's nuclear security enterprise to prepare for, prevent, mitigate, and respond to a nuclear or radiological incident domestically or abroad, providing technical advice to interagency and international partners and state and local organizations in support of nuclear counterproliferation, nuclear counterterrorism, nuclear incident response, and nuclear forensics, including helping to coordinate the interagency nuclear forensics mission."

Reg. 30568)) for program activities starting not later than September 30, 2020 and lasting for a period of 12 months: Provided further, That not less than $3,500,000 shall be for Voluntary Protection Programs.","Safety and Health Standards.--This activity provides for the protection of workers' safety and health through the development, promulgation, review, and evaluation of occupational safety and health standards and guidance, as specified under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act). Before any standard is proposed or promulgated, a determination is made that: (1) a significant risk of serious injury or health impairment exists; (2) the standard will reduce this risk; (3) the standard is economically and technologically feasible; and (4) the standard is cost effective when compared with alternative regulatory proposals providing equal levels of protection. This activity also ensures, through the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA) process, that small business concerns are taken into account in the process of developing standards.Federal Enforcement.--This activity provides for the protection of employees through the enforcement of workplace standards promulgated under the OSH Act, through the physical inspection of worksites, and by providing guidance on how to comply with the requirements of OSHA standards. OSHA's enforcement strategy ranges from a selective targeting of inspections and related compliance activities to a focus on specific high-hazard industries and worksites. Enforcement is prioritized by the investigation of imminent danger situations and employee complaints, investigation of fatal and catastrophic accidents, programmed inspections of firms with injury and illness rates that are above the national average, and special emphasis inspections for serious safety and health hazards.Whistleblower Programs.--This activity provides for the enforcement of twenty-three whistleblower protection statutes, including Section 11(c) of the OSH Act, which prohibits any person from discharging or in any manner retaliating against any employee because the employee has exercised rights under the Act, including complaining to OSHA and seeking an OSHA inspection, participating in an OSHA inspection, and participating or testifying in any proceeding related to an OSHA inspection. In addition to the OSH Act, this activity includes administration of twenty-two other whistleblower protection statutes that protect employees who report violations of various airline, commercial motor carrier, consumer product, environmental, financial reform, food safety, health care reform, nuclear, pipeline, public transportation agency, railroad, maritime, automotive manufacturing, and securities laws.State Programs.--This activity supports states that assume responsibility for administering occupational safety and health programs under State Plans approved by the Secretary. Under section 23 of the OSH Act, grants matching up to 50 percent of total program costs are made to States that meet the Act's criteria for establishing and implementing State programs that are at least as effective as the Federal OSHA program. State programs, like Federal OSHA, provide a mix of enforcement, outreach, training, and compliance assistance activities.Technical Support.--This activity provides support for OSHA's emergency response activities, including responses to oil spills, hurricanes, tornados, and other natural or manmade disasters. This activity also provides specialized technical expertise and advice in support of a wide range of program areas, including construction, standards setting, variance determinations, compliance assistance, and enforcement. Areas of expertise include laboratory accreditation, industrial hygiene, occupational medicine, chemical analysis, equipment calibration, safety engineering, environmental impact statements, technical and scientific databases, computer-based outreach products, and emergency preparedness.Federal Compliance Assistance.--This activity supports a broad range of training, outreach, and cooperative programs that provide compliance assistance for employers and employees in protecting workers' safety and health, with particular emphasis on high-hazard industries, small business, and other hard-to-reach workers. OSHA works with employers and employees through cooperative programs, such as the Voluntary Protection Programs to recognize employers with exemplary safety and health programs, and Alliances and Strategic Partnerships, which commit organizations to proactively collaborate with OSHA. This activity also provides assistance to federal agencies in implementing and improving their job safety and health programs. Occupational safety and health training is provided at the OSHA Training Institute and affiliated Education Centers throughout the country. Compliance and technical assistance materials are prepared and disseminated to the public through various means, including online.State Compliance Assistance: Consultation Grants.--This activity supports 90 percent federally funded cooperative agreements with designated State agencies to provide free on-site safety and health consultation to small- and medium-sized employers upon request. State agencies tailor workplans to specific needs in each State while maximizing their impact on injury and illness rates in smaller establishments in high-hazard industries. These projects offer a variety of services, including safety and health program assessment and assistance, hazard identification and control, and training of employers and their employees.Safety and Health Statistics.--This activity supports the agency's information technology infrastructure, management of information, OSHA's webpage and web-based compliance assistance services, and the statistical basis for OSHA's programs and field operations. These services are provided through an integrated data network and statistical analysis and review. OSHA administers and maintains the recordkeeping system that serves as the foundation for the BLS survey on occupational injuries and illnesses and provides guidance on recordkeeping requirements to both the public and private sectors.Executive Direction and Administration.--This activity supports executive direction, planning and evaluation, management support, legislative liaison, interagency affairs, federal agency liaison, administrative services, and budgeting and financial control.PROGRAM STATISTICS 2019 actual 2020 est. 2021 est.Inspections:Federal inspections33,40133,29333,793State program inspections41,84942,68643,966Whistleblower cases3,0923,2003,400Consultation Visits26,21326,47527,004"

State, local, and tribal law enforcement and criminal justice professionals are responsible for the majority of the Nation's day-to-day crime prevention and control activities. The programs supported by this account help OJP partners throughout the Nation prevent and reduce the incidence of violent crime; improve law enforcement officer safety and wellness; address drug-related crime and substance abuse, such as opioids and stimulants; and identify innovative solutions to crime- and justice system-related challenges. These programs include a combination of formula and discretionary grant programs, coupled with robust training and technical assistance activities designed to build and enhance the crime fighting and criminal justice capabilities of OJP's state, local, and tribal partners. Priority programs in the 2021 Budget will support law enforcement efforts to reduce violent crime, promote officer safety and wellness, combat the addiction crisis, address the issue and impact of unsubmitted sexual assault kits, and help victims of crime.

The 2021 Budget also includes funding for the following CARA-authorized programs: Veterans Treatment Courts ($22 million), Residential Substance Abuse Treatment ($30 million), Justice and Mental Health Collaborations ($33 million), and the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program ($30 million).Second Chance Act Program.--This program provides grants to establish and expand various adult and juvenile offender reentry programs and funds related research.

Of this total, $6 million is to help states, localities, and tribes develop comprehensive, innovative probation and parole supervision programs and $5 million is for the Children of Incarcerated Parents Demonstration Grant Program.STOP School Violence Act Program.--This program aims to prevent or mitigate incidents of school violence. It supports training for teachers and education for students with the intent to prevent school violence, as well as specialized training for school officials in responding to related mental health crises that may precipitate violent attacks on schools. The program also promotes state, local, and tribal efforts to improve school security through evidence-based school safety programs making use of physical security measures, technology, and coordination with local law enforcement. The 2021 Budget proposes $150 million for this program.Combating Human Trafficking.--The 2021 Budget proposes $120 million to support human trafficking grant programs, including $80 million to support comprehensive and specialized services for human trafficking victims and $40 million to support trafficking investigations and prosecutions.

Support may be provided in the form of grants or grant agreements, cooperative agreements, non-cash contributions, and other Federal support, but does not include amounts received as reimbursement for services rendered to individuals. Through a variety of programs, FEMA provides for grants, training, exercises, and other support to assist Federal agencies, States, territories, and tribal and local jurisdictions to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from terrorism and natural disasters.Grants: FEMA provides State and local preparedness grants that focus on building and sustaining the 32 core capabilities associated with the five mission areas described in the National Preparedness Goal. These grants include: 1) the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which supports the implementation of State homeland security strategies to address identified planning, organization, equipment, training, and exercise needs to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events; 2) the Urban Area Security Initiative, which addresses the unique risk-driven and capabilities-based planning, organization, equipment, training, and exercise needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas based on capability targets identified during the Threat Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment process; 3) the Transit Security Grant Program for public transportation security assistance and railroad security assistance, which supports owners and operators of transit systems, including intra-city bus, commuter bus, ferries, and all forms of passenger rail, to protect critical surface transportation infrastructure and the traveling public from acts of terrorism and to increase the resilience of transit infrastructure; 4) the Port Security Grant Program, which improves port-wide maritime security risk management, enhances maritime domain awareness, supports maritime security training and exercises, and maintains and/or reestablishes maritime security mitigation protocols that support port recovery and resiliency capabilities; 5) Firefighter Assistance Grants, including the Assistance to Firefighter Grant and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grants, which provide direct assistance to local fire departments for investments to improve their ability to safeguard the lives of firefighting personnel and members of the public in the event of a terrorist attack or other major incident; 6) Emergency Management Performance Grants, which provides funding on a formula basis to all 56 States and Territories to achieve target levels of capability in catastrophic planning and emergency management; 7) the Flood Hazard Mapping and Risk Analysis program, which drives national actions to reduce flood risk by addressing flood hazard data update needs, supporting local government hazard mitigation planning, and providing the flood risk data needed to manage the NFIP's financial exposure; 8) The National Security and Resilience Grant Program which provides financial assistance on a competitive basis to non-Federal entities to address specific, existing, and emerging threats as identified and prioritized by the Secretary through the Administrator; 9) Targeted violence and terrorism prevention grants to provide State and local governments, law enforcement, emergency management, and other partners the ability to support locally-based prevention programs and expand existing counterterrorism programs. Education, Training, and Exercises Programs: FEMA provides specialized training to emergency responders and supports development, execution, and evaluation of exercises to test the Nation's preparedness for all hazards. These programs include: 1) the National Exercise Program, which designs, coordinates, conducts, and evaluates exercises that rigorously test the Nation's ability to perform missions and functions that prevent, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards; 2) the Center for Domestic Preparedness, which provides specialized all-hazards preparedness training to State, local, and tribal emergency responders on skills tied to national priorities, in particular those related to Weapons of Mass Destruction; 3) the Emergency Management Institute, which provides training to Federal, State, local, tribal, volunteer, public, and private sector officials to strengthen emergency management core competencies, knowledge, and skills, thus improving the Nation's capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards; and 4) the U.S. Fire Administration, which promotes fire awareness, safety, and risk reduction across communities and prepares the Nation's first responders through ongoing training in evaluating and minimizing community risk, improving protection of critical infrastructure, and preparing to respond to all-hazard emergencies."

Major programs include the periodic economic programs (including the five-year economic census and census of governments), the American Community Survey, and the decennial census. In addition, other programs provide bureau-wide geographic information and data collection and dissemination systems.Periodic Economic Programs.--The Periodic Economic Programs include the Economic Census and the Census of Governments. These programs are integral to the Bureau of Economic Analysis' estimates of gross domestic product, industry inputs and outputs, and the economic activities of more than 90,000 State and local governments. Together, these programs measure the structure and functioning of the U.S. economy.  In 2021, the Census Bureau will finalize the last releases related to the 2017 Economic Census, while efforts will shift to planning, development, and monitoring activities related to the 2022 Economic Census and Census of Governments.Decennial Census.--As 2020 ends, the 2020 Census will enter a final, critical phase. In 2021, the Census Bureau will release data for apportionment and redistricting. Additionally, several significant field operations will still be ongoing at the start of 2021. Coverage and quality operations, including the post-enumeration survey, will independently measure the accuracy of the 2020 Census. Nearly 147 million housing unit responses will continue through processing, editing, disclosure avoidance, storage, and preparation for publishing. With a focus on data quality, security, and confidentiality, rigorous processes will ensure the 2020 Census data is secure and ready to be tabulated, aggregated, and presented to the public. After operations end, the massive coordination of people, IT, and infrastructure necessary to conduct the 2020 Census will begin the complex process of ramping down. Field and office staff will be released, Area Census Offices will be closed, and devices and equipment will be decommissioned. As the operational need for the 52 systems of the 2020 Census ends, they will transition to their post-2020 Census state.  Pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Congress provided $6.696 billion in 2020 to support the Decennial Census, including $669 million dedicated towards Secretarial contingency needs that may arise during the Census operation such as major disasters or other unforeseen risks realized, and $263 million in additional sensitivity risks to support additional pay increases and any reduction in self-response rates beyond the current projections of the Census Bureau. However, the Budget does not anticipate that these funds will be needed in 2020, and the schedules above reflect that. If these funds are needed due to an unexpected increase in costs, these funds will remain available to--and be used by--the Census Bureau to carry out its constitutional mandate.The American Community Survey (ACS), part of the Decennial Census Program, provides current demographic, social, economic, and housing information about America's communities, from the largest cities to the smallest rural communities. The ACS, supported by a complete and accurate address system, has simplified the census design resulting in improvements in both coverage and data quality, while providing current data on detailed population, social, economic, and housing characteristics. Geographic Support.--The Geographic Support program provides address lists and supports partnerships with all levels of government and geographic areas, geospatial data products, and associated processing systems needed to meet the geographic requirements of all Census Bureau programs, including the 2020 Census. In 2021, the Census Bureau will launch the Frames initiative, which will integrate full count data on persons, places, and the economy for streamlined use by all Census Bureau surveys, censuses, and official products.Enterprise Data Collection &amp; Dissemination Systems.--The objective of the program is to support major data collection, processing, and dissemination systems for the Census Bureau's censuses and surveys. In 2021, the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing program will transition to the Data Ingest and Collection for the Enterprise program to support data collection for Census Bureau censuses and surveys. The program will focus on minimizing redundancy associated with multiple data collection systems and platforms that support different modes of collection and ingestion, including commercial and administrative datasets. With the decommissioning of the American Fact Finder, the Center for Enterprise Dissemination Services and Consumer Innovation will deliver all data products for the 2020 Census data, the American Community Survey, the Economic Census, and other major programs. Additionally, the Census Bureau will expand efforts to provide disclosure protection, improve data analytics and accessibility by preserving historical information and metadata about censuses and surveys, and modernize data storage and data analysis capabilities across all of its directorates through the Enterprise Data Lake.  The Census Bureau will establish an enterprise-wide capability to expand the use of administrative records to improve sample survey operations, data quality, and data products and continue to support the Administrative Records Clearinghouse in providing the Federal government with increased capacity to make data-driven decisions about critical programs and provide transparency about program effectiveness."

NIST is authorized by the NIST Organic Act (15 USC 271), which outlines major roles for NIST in promoting national competitiveness and innovation. For more than 110 years, NIST has maintained the national standards of measurement, a role that the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Federal Government to ensure fairness in the marketplace. NIST was founded in 1901 and is one of the nation's oldest physical science laboratories. Today, the NIST Laboratory Programs work at the frontiers of measurement science to ensure that the U.S. system of measurements is firmly grounded on sound scientific and technical principles. The NIST Laboratories address increasingly complex measurement challenges, ranging from the very small (quantum devices for sensing and advanced computing) to the very large (vehicles and buildings), and from the physical infrastructure to the virtual (cybersecurity and the internet of things). As new technologies develop and evolve, NIST's measurement research and services remain critical to national defense, homeland security, trade, and innovation."

CBP is responsible for inspecting travelers at the land, sea, and air ports-of-entry (POEs) for immigration, customs, and agriculture compliance, as well as interdicting illegal entrants between the POEs. CBP enforces the laws regarding admission of foreign-born persons into the United States; identifies and apprehends aliens; and ensures that all goods and persons entering and exiting the United States do so legally. CBP's over 60,000 highly-trained employees ensure that the agency performs its mission with vigilance, integrity, and professionalism.The Operations and Support appropriation funds necessary operations, mission support, and associated management and administrative costs. Major programs include:Border Security Operations.--This program funds activities designed to protect the Nation through the coordinated use of Border Patrol Agents, technology, and air and marine forces to detect, interdict, and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States. These activities contribute to securing America's Southwest, Northern, and Coastal borders. Through the coordinated use of operational capabilities and assets of the U.S. Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations, CBP prevents terrorism and terrorist weapons, illegal aliens, smugglers, narcotics, and other contraband from moving across the borders of the United States.Trade and Travel Operations.--This program funds the mitigation of terrorist threats and the prevention of contraband from entering the U.S. while facilitating the legal flow of people and trade. CBP achieves this mission by deploying CBP officers to the POEs and by using a combination of technology, intelligence, risk information, targeting, and international cooperation to screen inbound international cargo and travelers and, in targeted border areas, to screen departing export cargo. Additional attention to outbound travel along areas of the Southwest border helps prevent the exit of money and weapons for illegal purposes. CBP has extended a zone of security beyond the United States' physical borders through bilateral cooperation with other nations, private-sector partnerships, expanded targeting, and advance scrutiny of information on people and products coming into the U.S.Integrated Operations.--This program captures the activities to establish the foundation for an integrated, all-hazards planning framework helping to mitigate routine emergencies, catastrophic events and interruptions of border security operations both at and between the ports of entry. Activities funded in the program operate at the national level and are not limited to a specific geographical area. Integrated Operations include funding for command and control, coordination, occupational health and safety, and information and situational awareness for multiple CBP mission programs.Mission Support.--This program captures activities that are standardized across the Department of Homeland Security that provide enterprise leadership, management, and/or business administration services and describes the capabilities and activities that support the day-to-day management and back office functions enabling both CBP and the Department to operate efficiently and effectively. Key capabilities include conducting agency planning and performance management; managing finances; managing agency workforce to include recruiting, hiring, screening, equipping, and training new employees; providing physical and personnel security; acquiring goods and services; managing information technology; managing agency property and assets; managing agency communications; managing legal affairs; and providing general management and administration."

OBO also ensures the safety of the building occupants through the development of fire/life safety and accessibility compliance programs.In 2021, the Department will manage the seventeenth year of the Capital Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) Program. This program has two main goals: accelerating the construction of new safe, secure and functional embassy and consulate compounds, and providing an incentive for all United States Government agencies to right-size their presence overseas through the use of cost-sharing. The $2.2 billion program is consistent with the Benghazi Accountability Review Board's recommended funding level for the construction of new secure facilities overseas. Funding sources include ESCM appropriations, interagency contributions, and consular fee revenues.The 2021 request continues the Maintenance Cost Sharing (MCS) Program to provide critically needed renovation, construction and repair of overseas facilities, to provide adequate working conditions for multi-agency staffs, and protect the U.S. taxpayer investment. MCS and CSCS are funded within a combined $2.2 billion program in FY 2021.The objective of the Asset Management Program is to obtain the best use of diplomatic and consular properties overseas through sale of surplus or underutilized properties and reinvestment of the proceeds in properties that provide a greater return to the U.S. Government and/or improve the safety of mission personnel. In lieu of appropriated resources, OBO uses asset sales proceeds for long-term capital investment to minimize the growth of U.S. Government leasehold requirements (through property acquisition) or to address a high-priority need for new construction or fit-out of leased space.This appropriation also provides for capital expenditures necessary to preserve, maintain, repair, and plan for buildings owned or leased by the Department of State overseas."

The Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 was amended on April 4, 1996, by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (1996 Act), P.L. 104-127. FSA administers a variety of activities, such as farm income support programs through various loans and payments; the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); the Emergency Conservation Program; the Hazardous Waste Management Program; farm ownership, farm operating, emergency disaster, and other loan programs; and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which provides crop loss protection for growers of many crops for which crop insurance is not available. This consolidated administrative expenses account includes funds to cover expenses of programs administered by, and functions assigned to, FSA. The funds consist of a direct appropriation, transfers from program loan accounts under credit reform procedures, user fees, and advances and reimbursements from other sources. This is a consolidated account for administrative expenses of national, regional, State, and county offices. The 2021 Budget requests a total of $1.48 billion for administrative expenses.USDA's Service Center Agencies comprise FSA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Rural Development offices that act as separate franchises, with offices often located adjacent to each other. Prior efforts to improve the efficiency of USDA's county-based offices have resulted in significant co-location and introduction of new information technology to simplify customer transactions.Farm programs.--These programs provide an economic safety net through farm income support to eligible producers, cooperatives, and associations to help improve the economic stability and viability of the agricultural sector and to ensure the production of an adequate and reasonably priced supply of food and fiber. Activities of the Agency include providing price loss coverage and agriculture risk coverage, providing marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments enabling recipients to continue farming operations without marketing their product immediately after harvest, and providing a financial safety net to eligible producers when natural disasters adversely affect their farming operation. These programs range from covering losses of grazing under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program; orchard trees and nursery to help replant or rehabilitate trees under the Tree Assistance Program; production under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program; livestock under the Livestock Indemnity Program; and livestock, honeybees and farm raised fish for losses that are not covered under the previously listed programs under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm Raised Fish.Farm program activities include the following functions dealing with the administration of programs carried out through the farmer committee system of the FSA: (a) developing program regulations and procedures; (b) collecting and compiling basic data for individual farms; (c) establishing individual farm base acres for farm planting history; (d) notifying producers of established base acres and farm planting histories; (e) conducting referendums and certifying results; (f) accepting farmer certifications and checking compliance for specific purposes; (g) processing commodity loan documents and issuing checks; (h) processing price loss coverage and agricultural risk coverage payments and issuing checks; (i) certifying payment eligibility and monitoring payment limitations; and (j) processing farm storage facility loans and issuing checks.Conservation and environment.--These programs assist agricultural producers and landowners in implementing practices to conserve soil, water, air, and wildlife resources on America's farmland and ranches to help protect the human and natural environment. Objectives of the Agency include improving environmental quality, protecting natural resources, and enhancing habitat for fish and wildlife, including threatened and endangered species; providing Emergency Conservation Program funding for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate damaged farmland and for carrying out emergency conservation measures during periods of severe drought or flooding; protecting the public health of communities through implementation of the Hazardous Waste Management Program; and implementing contracting, financial reporting, and other administrative operations processes. These activities include: (a) processing producer requests for conservation cost-sharing and issuing conservation reserve rental payments; and (b) transferring funds to the Natural Resources Conservation Service and other agencies for other conservation programs.Farm loans (reimbursable).--Provides for administering the direct and guaranteed loan programs covered under the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund (ACIF). Objectives of the Agency include improving the economic viability of farmers and ranchers, reducing losses in direct loan programs, responding to loan making and servicing requests, and maximizing financial and technical assistance to underserved groups. Activities include reviewing applications, servicing the loan portfolio, and providing technical assistance and guidance to borrowers. Funding for farm loan administrative expenses is transferred to this consolidated account from the ACIF. Appropriations representing subsidy amounts necessary to support the individual program loan levels under Federal Credit Reform are made to the ACIF account.Other reimbursable activities.--FSA collects a fee or is reimbursed for performing a variety of services for other Federal agencies, CCC, industry, and others, including certain administrative support services for county office services provided to Federal and non-Federal entities, including a variety of services to producers."

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115-91), Subtitle G--Modernizing Government Technology (MGT), Section 1078 established the TMF and Technology Modernization Board (Board). The TMF is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in accordance with recommendations made by the inter-agency TMF Board established by the MGT Act. The Board is chaired by the Administrator of the Office of Electronic Government and comprises six additional members, delineated in the Act, possessing expertise in IT development, financial management, cybersecurity and privacy, and acquisition.In accordance with OMB guidance, the Board rigorously reviews agency modernization proposals and recommends projects for funding, including identifying opportunities to migrate multiple legacy systems to common platforms; ensuring prioritization of projects with the greatest Government-wide impact and probability of success; and improvements to the security of critical IT infrastructure. As TMF funding is allocated to priority projects across the Federal Government, it is subsequently replenished by incremental agency repayments to the Fund for amounts transferred. This includes the cost of any services or work performed related to the administration of the Fund, ensuring that the TMF is self-sustaining and can continue to support modernization projects well beyond the initial infusions of capital. The GSA Administrator, in consultation with the Board and Director of OMB, is responsible for continuous oversight of funded projects to ensure success. Additionally, technical experts are paired with specific projects on a reimbursable basis to help execute quickly and successfully. All funding will be provided in increments based on agile development practices and is subject to agencies achieving planned project milestones.Ultimately, retiring or modernizing vulnerable and inefficient legacy IT systems will make agencies more secure and save money. Absent immediate action, the cost to operate and maintain legacy systems will continue to grow while security vulnerabilities and other risks will remain unresolved. As a means of addressing these pressing challenges, the TMF is an important step in changing the way the Federal Government manages its IT portfolio. The Board has reviewed more than three dozen project proposals from Federal agencies requesting more than $446 million and has approved nine modernization projects totaling $88 million in project awards."

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5133).","Through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides a significant portion of the total Federal response to Presidentially-declared major disasters and emergencies. Primary assistance programs include Federal assistance to individuals and households, public assistance, and hazard mitigation assistance which includes the repair and reconstruction of State, tribal, territorial, local, and nonprofit infrastructure. Beginning in 2012, section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended (BBEDCA) includes a discretionary spending cap adjustment for disaster relief, facilitating a shift from a reliance on supplemental appropriations. The BBEDCA, as amended by the 2018 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act requires funds designated as disaster relief pursuant to the cap adjustment be used for declared major disasters as defined under section 102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.The DRF funds requested as an adjustment to the discretionary spending caps consist of four principal components: (1) catastrophic obligations; (2) non-catastrophic obligations; (3) recoveries; and (4) a reserve. Funds required for the catastrophic category, defined as events greater than $500 million, are based on FEMA spend plans for all past declared catastrophic events and do not include funds for new catastrophic events that may occur in 2021. It is assumed that any new catastrophic event in 2021 will be funded through a future supplemental funding request, as provided for in BBEDCA. The non-catastrophic amount is based on an approach that uses the 10-year average for non-catastrophic events to provide a more realistic projection of non-catastrophic needs in 2021.  Pursuant to section 1234 of P.L. 115-254, the request also includes a 6-percent set-aside based on a historical average for pre-disaster mitigation, also known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities. The DRF base non-cap adjustment request supports the 10-year average for the costs associated with emergency declarations, pre-disaster surge activities, and fire management assistance grants. The base also includes funds requested for projected yearly disaster readiness and support costs."

The USGS also works in collaboration with other Federal, State, tribal, and municipal cooperators to conduct research and provide scientific data and information concerning natural hazards and natural resource issues, including the water, land, geologic, and biological resources of the Nation. The USGS budget continues science programs that generate relevant, objective information for natural resource managers and for communities throughout the Nation and engages in partnerships with universities, research institutions, and major public and private laboratories.Ecosystems.--The USGS Ecosystems mission area provides scientific information needed by Interior for sound management of both Federal lands and trust lands and species. Science in the mission area studies the consequences of environmental change and the effects of alternative management actions on lands and species.  Information and tools provided by the mission area help evaluate risk and control the spread of economically and ecologically harmful invasive species and wildlife diseases.Energy and Mineral Resources.--The USGS Energy and Mineral Resources mission area conducts scientific research on the location, quantity, and quality of the Nation's and the world's energy and mineral resources. The mission area provides valuable science to better understand the Nation's mineral and energy resource potential, supply, production, and consumption and the impacts of resource development. Accurate scientific information about America's energy and mineral resources is critical, as our Nation depends on energy to power our homes and businesses and on minerals to manufacture products we rely on every day, from our phones and laptops to the cars we drive. The science provided by the mission area is used to inform strategic, evidence-based economic and geopolitical decisions and facilitates responsible natural resource development. Natural Hazards.--The USGS plays a critical role in providing policymakers and the public with a clear understanding of potential threats from natural hazards, societal vulnerability to these threats, and strategies for improving resilience to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, hurricanes, geomagnetic storms, tsunamis, and wildfires. The USGS Natural Hazards mission area is working with its partners and stakeholders to define and mitigate risks, build understanding of natural hazard processes, and characterize potential impacts on human activity and health, the economy, and the environment. This mission area includes USGS activities that characterize and assess coastal and marine processes, conditions, change, and vulnerability.Water Resources.--The USGS is the primary Federal science agency providing information about water resources. To fulfill this responsibility, the USGS Water Resources mission area monitors and assesses the amount and characteristics of the Nation's water resources, assesses sources and behavior of contaminants in the water environment, and develops tools to improve management and understanding of water resources. This work supports Federal, State, tribal, and municipal government decisions in managing water resources for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial, recreational, and ecological uses; protects and enhances water resources for human health, aquatic health, and environmental quality; minimizes loss of life and property as a result of water-related natural hazards, such as floods, droughts, and land movement; and contributes to sustainable stewardship and development of the Nation's resources for the benefit of present and future generations.Core Science Systems.--The USGS Core Science Systems mission area leads the bureau's mission as the civilian mapping agency for the Nation--a 141-year legacy since its establishment in 1879. The USGS conducts detailed surveys and distributes the resulting high-quality and highly-accurate topographic, geologic, hydrographic, and biogeographic maps and remotely-sensed data to the public. Mapping accuracy enabled by cutting-edge technologies allows precise planning for recreational use on public lands; collaborative conservation with Interior partners; critical minerals assessments; energy development; transportation and pipeline infrastructure projects; urban planning and development; land change and flood prediction at regional, local, and neighborhood scales; emergency response; and hazards mitigation. The USGS Core Science Systems mission area is the Federal steward of this high-quality geospatial data, and provides access to the public through The National Map, the National Land Cover Database, the National Geologic Map Database, the USGS Earth Explorer, and the National Biogeographic Map. The USGS also operates the Landsat satellites and data systems necessary to understand, monitor, and detect changes that affect the Nation's natural and agricultural resources, economy, public safety and national security, and historical heritage.Science Support.--The USGS Science Support program funds essential science leadership as well as critical functions such as: scientific integrity processes; sharing and communicating science findings; purchasing science equipment and field supplies; executing science agreements with partners; contracting for support scientists and researchers; safety training; hazardous waste management; succession planning and execution; and information technology, which supports the scientific process and information management of scientific data. Science Support also provides bureau-wide executive direction and coordination, business administration, and financial management.Facilities.--The USGS Facilities program provides safe, functional workspace, laboratories, and facilities for the USGS to accomplish its scientific mission. The mission area provides rental payments and operation and maintenance for properties and deferred maintenance and capital improvement for owned assets.Reimbursable Program.--This program includes reimbursements from non-Federal sources (States, Tribes, and municipalities) for: cooperative efforts; proceeds from the sale of copies of photographs and records and the sale of personal property; reimbursements from permittees and licensees of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and reimbursements from foreign countries and international organizations for technical assistance. The USGS also receives reimbursements from other Federal agencies for mission-related work performed at the request of the financing agency."

The PATH Act also extended and modified this provision for 2016 through 2019.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97) (TCJA) repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax.

NRCS provides technical assistance to farmers, ranchers and other private landowners to support the development of conservation plans that are designed to safeguard natural resources and improve wildlife habitat.  These plans are often used as a spring board toward receiving financial assistance through mandatory Farm Bill conservation programs.  NRCS provides additional science-based support for conservation efforts through soil surveys, snow survey and water supply forecasting, and plant materials centers. These activities are supported by appropriated funding, including funding requested in the Private Lands Conservation Operations account, and by mandatory funding in the Farm Security and Rural Investment account. NRCS comprises over 9,000 employees with a wide range of natural resource backgrounds, including soil and rangeland conservation, plant science, wildlife biology, forestry and engineering. Through this collective conservationist workforce, the Administration strives to protect the natural resource base on private lands. The 2021 Budget requests a total of $830 million for Private Lands Conservation Operations. In addition, to provide a more accurate picture of the total staff resources necessary to implement voluntary conservation, the Budget displays mandatory technical assistance of $1.19 billion in this account.Technical assistance.--Through the Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) Program, NRCS provides its customers and partners -- agricultural producers, private landowners, conservation districts, Tribes, and other organizations -- the knowledge and conservation tools they need to conserve, maintain, and improve our private-land natural resources. This assistance centers around individual and landscape-scale conservation plans that contain optimal strategies tailored to protect the resources on the land they manage. Actions described in the plans help land managers reduce erosion; protect water quality and quantity; improve air quality; enhance the quality of fish and wildlife habitat; improve long-term sustainability of all lands; and facilitate land use changes while protecting and sustaining our natural resources. The CTA Program also provides the science-based tools that support conservation planning.MAIN WORKLOAD FACTORS 2019 actual2020 est.2021 est.Customers receiving technical assistance for planning &amp; application, number127,433130,000130,000Conservation systems planned, million acres31.433.733.7Cropland with conservation applied to improve soil quality, million acres5.65.85.8Grazing land with conservation applied to protect the resource base, million acres11.711.711.7In addition to technical assistance for conservation planning provided through the CTA Program, NRCS also offers technical assistance for the design, implementation, and management of conservation practices through mandatory Farm Bill conservation programs under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Programs. This combined technical assistance funding provides for the salaries and expenses of conservation professionals, including NRCS's extensive field staff and a growing number of technical service providers and other cooperators who work with land managers in assessing and applying conservation strategies.Soil surveys.--The primary focus of the Soil Survey Program is to provide current and consistent map interpretations and data sets of the soil resources of the United States. Managing soil as a strategic natural resource is key to the vitality of the Nation's economy. Scientists and policy makers use soil survey information to help evaluate the sustainability and environmental effects of land use and management practices. Soil surveys are used by planners, engineers, farmers, ranchers, developers, and home owners to evaluate soil suitability and make management decisions for farms, home sites, subdivisions, commercial and industrial sites, and wildlife and recreational areas. NRCS is the lead Federal agency for the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), a partnership of Federal land management agencies, State agricultural experiment stations, private consultants, and State and local governments that works to cooperatively investigate, inventory, document, classify, interpret, disseminate, and publish information about soils. NRCS provides the scientific expertise to enable the NCSS to develop and maintain a uniform system for mapping and assessing soil resources.MAIN WORKLOAD FACTORS 2019 actual2020 est.2021 est.Acres mapped annually (millions)44.74545Snow survey and water supply forecasting.--The purpose of the program is to provide western States and Alaska with information on annual water supplies for decisions relating to agricultural production, fish and wildlife management, municipal and industrial water supply, urban development, flood control, recreation, hydroelectric power generation, and water quality management. NRCS field staff and cooperators collect and analyze data on snow depth, snow water equivalent, and other climate parameters at approximately 2,000 remote, high elevation data collection sites. The water supply forecasts are used by individual farmers and ranchers; water resource managers; Federal, State, and local government agencies; municipal and industrial water providers; hydroelectric power generation utilities; irrigation districts; fish and wildlife management agencies; reservoir project managers; recreationists; Tribal Nations; and the countries of Canada and Mexico.Plant Material Centers (PMCs).-- NRCS's network of 25 PMCs identify, evaluate, and demonstrate the performance of plants and plant technologies to help solve natural resource problems and improve the utilization of our nation's natural resources. PMCs continue to build on their long and successful history of releasing plants for resource conservation that have been instrumental at increasing the commercial availability of appropriate plant materials to the public. PMC activities contribute to reducing soil erosion; increasing cropland soil health and productivity; restoring wetlands, improving water quality, improving wildlife habitat (including pollinators); protecting streambank and riparian areas; stabilizing coastal dunes; producing forage; improving air quality; and addressing other conservation treatment needs.The results of studies conducted by PMCs provide much of the basis for NRCS vegetative recommendations and conservation practices. The work ensures that NRCS conservation practices are scientifically-based, improves the knowledge of NRCS field staff through PMC-led training sessions and demonstrations, and develops recommendations to meet new and emerging natural resource issues. PMCs carry out their work cooperatively with State and Federal agencies, universities, Tribes, commercial businesses, and seed and nursery associations. PMC activities directly benefit private landowners as well as Federal and State land managing agencies.The Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center is a centralized operations office within the FPAC Mission Area responsible for financial management, budgeting, human resources, information technology, acquisitions/procurement, customer experience, internal controls, risk management, strategic and annual planning, and other similar activities for the FPAC Mission area and its component agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA), the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the Risk Management Agency (RMA). This account includes a funding reduction that offsets, in part, the request for the FPAC Business Center. The funding requested for the FPAC Business Center will streamline the FPAC mission area.  The estimate is based on 39 current staffing, and will consolidate the NRCS Geospatial Center of Excellence with the Existing FPAC Business Center Geospatial capabilities."

For conservation programs where NRCS is the lead implementation agency, funds are transferred from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) to the Farm Security and Rural Investment Programs account. This mandatory funding supports NRCS's efforts to protect the natural resource base on private lands by providing technical assistance to farmers, ranchers and other private landowners to support the development of conservation plans, and by providing financial assistance to partially offset the cost to implement conservation measures necessary to safeguard natural resources and improve wildlife habitat and provide funding to acquire easements either directly, or through third parties.The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 amended Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, reauthorizing some programs, and creating one new conservation program that is administered by NRCS. A number of conservation programs were extended in the 2021 Budget's baseline beyond 2023 based upon scorekeeping conventions.In 2021, the Administration proposes to show the total staff resources necessary to implement its private lands conservation program in the Private Lands Conservation Operations account. Importantly, this new display will not alter the current authorities under which staff resources are provided through mandatory and discretionary funding. This account will continue to show the funding provided for the financial assistance costs necessary for delivering the following programs:Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).--This program is authorized under Subchapter A of Chapter 4 of Subtitle D of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended.  The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 reauthorizes the program through 2023, and the 2021 Budget assumes that the program extends beyond that date in the baseline for scorekeeping purposes. The purpose of the program is to promote agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible national goals. EQIP promotes the voluntary application of land-based conservation practices and activities that maintain or improve the condition of the soil, water, plants, and air; conserve energy; and address other natural resource concerns. Eligible land includes cropland, rangeland, pastureland, private nonindustrial forestland, tribal land, and other farm or ranch lands.  In 2021, the Budget proposes $1.8 billion for this program.Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP).--This program is authorized by Subchapter B of Chapter 4 of Subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 reauthorized the program through 2023, and the 2021 Budget assumes that the program extends beyond that date in the baseline for scorekeeping purposes. The program encourages producers to address resource concerns in a comprehensive manner by undertaking additional conservation activities and improving, maintaining and managing existing conservation activities. The 2021 Budget proposes $750 million for this program for new contracts, existing contracts, and reenrollments. The Budget also includes a proposal to eliminate the program.Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) Technical Assistance.--CRP is authorized by Sections 1231-1235A of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, and is administered by the Farm Service Agency. NRCS supports the program by providing technical assistance to producers to implement conservation practices on CRP land. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 reauthorized the program, and the 2021 Budget assumes $95 million in technical assistance for NRCS support of CRP.Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP).--ACEP consists of two components: 1) an agricultural land easement component under which NRCS assists eligible entities to protect agricultural land by limiting non-agricultural uses of that land through the purchase of agricultural land easements; and 2) a wetland reserve easement component under which NRCS provides financial and technical assistance directly to landowners to restore, protect and enhance wetlands through the purchase of wetlands reserve easements. The program is reauthorized through 2023 by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 under Subtitle H of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985. The 2021 Budget assumes that the program extends beyond 2023 in the baseline for scorekeeping purposes. For 2021, the Budget includes the authorized level of funding for ACEP at $450 million. The budget also includes a proposal to reduce the program by $40 million per year.Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP).--RCPP promotes the implementation of conservation activities through agreements between NRCS and partners and through conservation program contracts and easements with producers and landowners. The program is reauthorized through 2023 by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 under Subtitle I of Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985. Through agreements between partners and conservation program contracts or easements directly with producers and landowners, RCPP helps implement conservation projects that may focus on water quality and quantity, soil erosion, wildlife habitat, drought mitigation, flood control, or other regional priorities. The 2021 Budget assumes that the program extends beyond 2023 in the baseline for scorekeeping purposes. The authorized level of funding for RCPP is $300 million.Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program (VPA-HIP).--The program is authorized by Section 1240R of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended by Section 2406 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018.  VPA-HIP provides $50 million for obligations between 2019 through 2023 (this program was not extended in the baseline). VPA-HIP is a competitive grant program. Funding is limited to State and Tribal governments establishing new public access programs, expanding existing public access programs, and/or enhancing wildlife habitat on lands enrolled in public access programs.Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program.--The program is authorized by Sections 2408 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. The program provides $75 million for obligations between 2019 and 2023 (this program was not extended in the baseline), of which NRCS is to receive 50 percent. The program will be implemented by NRCS and the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service. The program will be used to respond to the threat feral swine pose to agriculture, native ecosystems, and human and animal health. In addition to the programs authorized under the Food Security Act of 1985, NRCS implements the following conservation programs:Agricultural Management Assistance Program (AMA).--This program is authorized by Section 524(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1524(b)), as amended. It authorizes $10 million annually for the program, of which NRCS is to receive 50 percent. This program is implemented by NRCS, the Agricultural Marketing Service, and the Risk Management Agency.  AMA activities are carried out in 16 States in which participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program is historically low. The program provides assistance to producers to mitigate financial risk by using conservation to reduce soil erosion and improve water quality. The 2021 Budget proposes $5 million for the program.NRCS works to deliver conservation programs using its technical field staff and by partnering with public and private entities through the Technical Service Provider (TSP) system. NRCS can contract with TSPs to help deliver the Farm Bill programs, or agricultural producers may select TSPs to help plan and implement conservation practices on their operations.The U.S. has made great strides in improving water quality; however, nonpoint source pollution remains a significant challenge that requires policy attention and thoughtful new approaches. In 2021, the Budget continues the agency's efforts to better coordinate conservation efforts among key Federal partners, along with agricultural producer organizations, conservation districts, States, Tribes, non-governmental organizations and other local leaders to identify areas where a focused and coordinated approach can achieve substantial improvements in water quality. The Budget builds upon the collaborative process already underway among Federal partners to demonstrate substantial improvements in water quality from conservation programs by ensuring that USDA's key investments through Farm Bill conservation programs and related efforts are appropriately leveraged by other Federal programs.Finally, the Agricultural Act of 2014 repealed the Wetlands Reserve Program, Grasslands Reserve Program and the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program and included the purposes of those programs in the ACEP referred to above. The Agricultural Act of 2014 also repealed the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program, Chesapeake Bay Watershed Program, Great Lakes Basin Program, and the Cooperative Conservation Partnership Initiative and included the purposes of those programs in RCPP referred to above. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program was also repealed, and its purposes are now included in EQIP.The Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) Business Center is a centralized operations office within the FPAC Mission Area responsible for financial management, budgeting, human resources, information technology, acquisitions/procurement, customer experience, internal controls, risk management, strategic and annual planning, and other similar activities for the FPAC Mission area and its component agencies, including NRCS, the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and the Risk Management Agency (RMA). This account includes a transfer of $60,228,000 to offset funds associated with administration and oversight of mandatory conservation programs. The funding requested for the FPAC Business Center is an estimate based on current staffing in the FPAC agencies, including NRCS, FSA, and RMA, and the estimated costs in support of the Business Center."

The FPD appropriation provides for the care of Federal detainees in private, State, and local facilities, which includes housing, subsistence, transportation, medical care, and medical guard service.The Federal Government utilizes various methods to house detainees. The USMS acquires detention bed space for Federal detainees through several means, using the most appropriate method to maximize efficiency and effectiveness for the Government: 1) Federally-owned and managed detention facilities, where the Government has paid for construction and operation of the facility, funded through the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) account; 2) Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) with State and local jurisdictions, whose excess prison and jail bed capacity is utilized via a negotiated daily rate paid to those jurisdictions; and 3) Private performance-based contract facilities, where an individual daily rate or contract minimum rate is paid. Over 80 percent of the USMS's Federally-detained population will likely be housed in State, local, and private facilities.For 2021, the USMS requests an increase of $479.1 million for housing, medical, and transportation costs associated with the projected USMS detention population. Within that funding, the USMS requests $2.1 million for six new positions to expand oversight and administration of private detention facility contracts, and to establish additional capability to ensure that State and local facilities meet established standards of confinement when providing detention bedspace through IGAs. Finally, the USMS requests $2.0 million to establish a task force to explore cost mitigation efforts that will address the rising cost of detention.The USMS will continue to identify cost reduction and avoidance opportunities through process and infrastructure improvements. The costs associated with these efforts are funded from the FPD appropriation. In recent years, the USMS has successfully implemented a number of efficiency initiatives, including:1) eDesignate, which was developed to provide a more efficient workflow between the U.S. Courts, the USMS, and the BOP;2) core-rate IGA, which standardizes the pricing strategy for paying for non-federal detention space in order to control costs;3) the Quality Assurance Review Program, which ensures non-federal facilities' housing meet Department of Justice requirements for safe, secure and humane confinement; and4) increased use of detention alternatives by providing funding to the Federal Judiciary to support alternatives to pretrial detention, such as electronic monitoring, halfway house placement, and drug testing and treatment."

DEA's major focus is the disruption and dismantlement of Priority Target Organizations (PTOs)--domestic and international drug trafficking and money laundering organizations having a significant impact on drug availability in the United States. DEA emphasizes PTOs with links to organizations on the Attorney General's Consolidated Priority Organization Target list, which represents the ""Most Wanted"" drug trafficking and money laundering organizations believed to be primarily responsible for the United States' illicit drug supply, including heroin. DEA also considers it a high priority to target the financial infrastructure of major drug trafficking organizations, and members of the financial community who facilitate the laundering of their proceeds. In 2019, DEA denied drug traffickers $5 billion in revenue through the seizure of both assets and drugs. In addition to keeping drugs and drug-related violence out of the United States, DEA plays a vital role in the areas of national and border security.DEA has 239 domestic offices organized in 23 divisions throughout the United States. Internationally, DEA has 90 offices in 67 countries and is responsible for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations abroad. Federal, State, local, and international partnerships continue to play an important role in DEA's enforcement efforts. For nearly 43 years, DEA has led a task force program that today includes nearly 3,000 task force officers participating in 292 task forces. DEA's Special Operations Division and the El Paso Intelligence Center are vital resources for Federal, State, and local law enforcement. Additionally, through the Office of National Security Intelligence, DEA ensures that national security information obtained in the course of conducting its drug law enforcement mission is expeditiously shared with the Intelligence Community.DEA's activities are divided into three decision units:Domestic Enforcement.--Through effective enforcement efforts and associated support functions, DEA disrupts and dismantles the leadership, command, control, and infrastructure of major drug trafficking syndicates, criminal organizations, and violent drug trafficking groups that threaten the United States. This decision unit contains most of DEA's resources, domestic enforcement groups, State and local task forces, other Federal and local task forces, intelligence groups, and all the support functions essential to accomplishing their mission. DEA's objectives for Domestic Enforcement include:--Identifying and targeting the national/regional organizations most responsible for the domestic distribution and manufacture of illicit drugs;--Systematically disrupting or dismantling targeted organizations by arresting/convicting their leaders and facilitators, seizing and forfeiting their assets, targeting their money laundering operations, and destroying their command and control networks; and,--Working with international offices to dismantle domestic organizations directly affiliated with Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCO).International Enforcement.--DEA works with its foreign counterparts to attack the vulnerabilities in the leadership, production, transportation, communications, finance, and distribution sectors of major international drug trafficking organizations. DEA's objectives for International Enforcement include:--Identifying and targeting the most significant international drug and chemical trafficking organizations;--Disrupting and dismantling the networks, financial infrastructures, operations, and resource bases of targeted international drug and chemical trafficking organizations; and--Preventing drug trafficking organizations from funding terrorist organizations and activities.State and Local Assistance.--DEA provides clandestine laboratory training, and meets the hazardous waste cleanup needs of the U.S. law enforcement community. DEA supports State and local law enforcement with assistance and training so that State and local agencies can better address the methamphetamine threat in their communities and reduce the impact that methamphetamine has on the quality of life for American citizens. As a result, DEA's nationwide contracts, container program, and established training programs allow DEA to provide State and local clandestine lab cleanup and training assistance in a cost-effective manner. For 2021, DEA is proposing to expand this program to pay for the cleanup of other illicit hazardous environments, such as clandestine fentanyl labs and pill press operations.  The proposed proviso will grant DEA the authority it needs to use these funds for this purpose and will not negatively impact DEA's ability to support state and local meth lab cleanups.For 2021, DEA requests $5.6 million for Cyber Enforcement to bolster key DEA programs to combat highly sophisticated TCOs that use cyber capabilities to further their criminal enterprises; $22.3 million to enhance agency programs and offices focused on targeting, disrupting, and dismantling TCOs known for supplying illicit substances to distributors and users in the United States; $27.6 million to better enable DEA to lawfully access and exploit the data of criminal organizations and indviduals; $9.2 million for the purchase of a King Air 350 aircraft to begin updating DEA's air fleet; and, $2.8 million for training capacity expansion to enable the recruitment and retention of key personnel and agents.For 2021, the Budget proposes to transfer the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program from the Office of National Drug Control Policy to DEA to improve coordination of drug enforcement efforts among Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies in the U.S."

Technical assistance and grants help facilitate sound resource stewardship by providing tools to address forest health threats on a landscape scale, while maintaining the flexibility for individual forest landowners and resource managers to pursue their objectives. This funding will support the Forest Service's Shared Stewardship strategy which aims to increase emphasis on work across boundaries with States and other partners to prioritize investments in lands that can make a difference in conditions across an entire landscape. This collaboration will accelerate gains in reducing fire risk and in improving resilient forest conditions. Specific areas of emphasis are:Landscape Scale Restoration.--Funds in the amount of $14 million for competitive grants that carry out science-based restoration of priority forest landscapes by reducing wildfire risk; improving fish and wildlife habitat; maintaining or improving water quality and watershed function; mitigating invasive species, insect infestation, and disease; improving important forest ecosystems; and measuring economic and ecological benefits, including air quality and soil quality and productivity. Forest Health Management.--Funds in the amount of $84.6 million for activities on Federal and cooperative lands to maintain healthy, productive ecosystems by preventing, detecting, and suppressing damaging native and invasive insect infestations and tree diseases across all land ownership jurisdictions, and invasive plants on cooperative lands. Based on a science-based forest health risk map, the 2021 Budget allocates funding to address national priorities and reduce risk for landscape damage in the most effective and efficient manner. The agency will document changes in insect, disease, and invasive plant geographic range, population dynamics of host preferences of pests, and other changes in pest activity, and will explore gene conservation efforts. Funding of this program is a critical part of the Forest Service's capacity to continue to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, improve water quality and quantity, and increase carbon sequestration.Cooperative Forestry.--Funds in the amount of $20.6 million are requested for the Working Forest Lands Program (previously the Forest Stewardship Program), which provides professional forestry assistance to landowners to encourage sound environmental management of non-industrial private forest lands. Cooperative forestry activities help maintain the integrity of our Nation's valuable forested landscapes, and support the Federal interest in obtaining and preserving for the public an array of social, economic, and environmental benefits from privately owned forests. The Forest Service will track how cooperative funds are targeted to priority areas and themes identified in State Forest Action Plans.Cooperative Fire Programs.--This request includes funding for the National Fire Capacity and Rural Fire Capacity programs in the amounts of $81.1 million and $17 million; respectively, to enhance the capacity of States to increase the fire adaptability of communities by providing grant funding and technical assistance to: (1) increase their initial attack capabilities, and (2) purchase and maintain firefighting equipment. Funding also supports training, planning, and fire prevention and education programs."

Firefighter and public safety are the primary considerations for all wildfire response operations. To support a Department-wide priority, $23.5 million is requested for investment toward an intra-agency Land Mobile Radio shared services model to lower costs, improve operational efficiencies, and better respond to emergencies. In addition, the Forest Service will direct $10 million in its Risk Management Assistance Framework to enhance line officer capacity to make wildfire response decisions using performance data and other tools developed by agency R&amp;D; and, will allocate $15 million to implement the Wildfire Technology Modernization section of the Dingell Conservation and Management Act of 2019. Preparedness.--Funds the agency capability to protect life, property, infrastructure and natural resources through an appropriate initial attack response.Preparedness provides for fire management assets that protect NFS lands, and other Federal, State, and private lands from damaging wildfires, thus reducing threats to life, property, infrastructure and natural resource values commensurate with land management objectives in the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy. Key components of wildland fire response mission delivery are fire season readiness, year-round capability and program leadership necessary to ensure appropriate, risk informed, and effective operations. Preparedness also supports other vital elements of a comprehensive wildland fire management program, including modernization of the large airtanker fleet, planning, prevention, development of information technology and decision support systems, training and education, development and advancement of firefighting technology, and organizational learning through program analysis and review.Through this program, the Forest Service also assists other Federal agencies and States with planning assistance, sharing joint equipment use contracts and interagency fire coordination centers. Readiness levels reflect improvements in efficiencies and management controls to strategically deploy firefighting resources, including predictive services analysis of fire season potential, web-based wildfire decision support tools, centralized management of aviation assets, ongoing analysis to optimize dispatch, and investment in information technology.Suppression Operations.--Provides for risk-informed extended attack suppression and large fire support at wildland fires on or threatening NFS lands, other Federal lands, and 20 million acres of non-Federal lands under fire protection agreements. The 2021 Budget requests funding at $1,011 million, the amount stipulated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) through Fiscal Year 2027. The Act also amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control act to provide additional new budget authority for fiscal years 2020 through 2027. Wildfires continue to be larger and more difficult to suppress due to the effects of persistent drought, hazardous fuel conditions, and the ongoing growth of residential and commercial development adjacent to fire-prone areas in the wildland-urban interface (WUI). The Forest Service recognizes the costs of WUI suppression activities, and will continue to aggressively pursue management improvements, including:-- using risk-informed, performance-based suppression strategies,-- clarifying roles and responsibilities in the WUI,-- using appropriate cost-share agreements and pursuing 100 percent cost recovery from Federal, State, and local entities, and-- deploying decision support tools.The Suppression program also funds Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) activities, which address situations where life, property, water quality, and deteriorated ecosystems may be further threatened from post-fire flooding and other damage. The BAER program provides for immediate emergency post-fire response to manage unacceptable risks to people and resources triggered by the changed conditions to the landscape in the aftermath of a fire.Development of necessary governance and risk management protocols to guide program management and incident response, with the application of resources to reduce unnecessary risk to firefighter safety in the short-term, and increase the long-term resilience of fire-adapted ecosystems, will continue to be a focus. The Forest Service will also continue efforts to allow fire to return to the landscape when it will improve the health of the forest, and when risks to community safety make it appropriate to do so."

Preparedness includes readiness, operational planning, oversight, procurement, training, supervision, and deployment of wildland fire suppression personnel and equipment prior to wildland fire occurrence, and rural fire readiness, in which assistance is provided to local cooperators to enhance their capacity to protect remote communities and natural resources. It also includes activities related to program monitoring and evaluation, and integration of fire into land-use planning.Suppression Operations.--Funds the emergency and unpredictable aspects of the Department's wildland fire management program. Suppression operations include the total spectrum of management actions taken on wildland fires in a safe, cost-effective manner, considering public benefits and values to be protected consistent with resource objectives and land management plans. Emergency actions taken during and immediately following a wildfire to stabilize the soil and structures to prevent erosion, floods, landslides, and further resource damage are included in this activity. Generally, emergency stabilization actions may be performed within one year of containment of a fire, however, exceptions to this time limit are allowed under certain circumstances. In fiscal years 2010 through 2017, funding for the ten-year average of inflation-adjusted suppression obligations was split between the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund and this appropriation. The 2021 Budget request fully funds suppression operations at the ten-year average of obligations as reported in the 2015 President's Budget, in accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). The Act also amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to provide additional new budget authority for fiscal years 2020 through 2027. This additional budget authority is provided in the Wildland Fire Suppression Operations Reserve Fund account, and made available subject to the requirements in P.L. 115-141.  This additional new budget authority will help ensure that adequate resources are available to the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to fight wildland fires, protect communities, and safeguard human life during the most severe wildland fire seasons. The DOI and Forest Service wildland fire management programs will continue to strengthen oversight and accountability of suppression spending and use risk management principles to guide decision-making at the strategic, program, and operational levels.Fuels Management.--Funds the application of fuels treatments aimed at mitigating risk to communities and their values, including areas in the wildland urban interface. This activity may also conduct treatments that improve the integrity and resilience of our forests and rangelands. The Fuels Management activity will contribute community adaption to fire and improve the ability to safely and appropriately respond to wildfire. Funding for the Fuels Management activity covers the planning, operational aspects, and monitoring of fuels treatments. The program will utilize such treatment methods as prescribed fire, mechanical, chemical, and biological treatments or a combination of methods.Other Operations.--Funds all other aspects of the wildland fire management program, which includes Fire Facilities Construction and Maintenance, Burned Area Rehabilitation, and Joint Fire Science. The Fire Facilities Construction and Maintenance program funds construction and maintenance of facilities to house firefighters and equipment used in wildland firefighting and fuels management activities. The 2021 Budget does not request funds for Fire Facilities Construction and Maintenance. Funds for these facilities may be included in the bureaus' construction and deferred maintenance budgets. The Burned Area Rehabilitation program begins the restoration process for lands and resources damaged by wildland fires that would not return to fire adapted conditions without intervention. Soil stabilization and the introduction of native and other desirable plant species are employed for up to three years, or up to five years under certain circumstances, following containment of a fire to return severely-burned areas to appropriate fire regimes and resource conditions. The Joint Fire Science subactivity funds the Department's share of the Joint Fire Science program, an interagency partnership that sponsors and delivers applied research to assist field managers with fuels treatment, post-fire rehabilitation, smoke management and many other related topics.

The GSM-102 Export Credit Guarantee Program covers credit terms of up to 18 months. Under this program, CCC does not provide financing, but guarantees payments due from foreign banks and buyers. Because payment is guaranteed, financial institutions in the United States can offer competitive credit terms to foreign banks, usually with interest rates based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). If the foreign bank fails to make any payment as agreed, the exporter or assignee must submit a notice of default to the CCC. A claim for loss must be filed, and the CCC will promptly pay claims found to be in good order. CCC usually guarantees 98 percent of the principal payment due and interest based on a percentage of the one-year Treasury rate.A portion of the GSM-102 guarantees is also made available as Facilities Guarantees. Under this activity, CCC guarantees export financing for capital goods and services to improve handling, marketing, processing, storage, or distribution of imported agricultural commodities and products.The subsidy estimates for the GSM-102 program are determined in large part by the obligor's sovereign or non-sovereign country risk grade. These grades are developed annually by the International Credit Risk Assessment System Committee (ICRAS). In unusual circumstances, an ICRAS grade for a country may change during the fiscal year. The default estimates for GSM-102 guarantees still use the ICRAS grades, but are now based on programmatic experience and country-specific assumptions rather than the government-wide risk premia used previously.As required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, this account records, for this program, the subsidy costs associated with the credit guarantees committed in 1992 and beyond (including modifications of credit guarantees that resulted from obligations or commitments in any year), as well as administrative expenses of this program. The subsidy amounts are estimated on a present value basis; the administrative expenses are estimated on a cash basis.

This mission is carried out through ARS' major research program areas: New Products/Product Quality/Value Added; Livestock/Crop Production; Livestock/Crop Protection; Food Safety; Human Nutrition; and Environmental Stewardship.The 2021 Salaries and Expenses Budget for ARS requests $1.368 billion, which supports ongoing intramural research conducted by ARS. The Budget also requests $81 million within this account for costs to operate and maintain the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), which replaces the outdated and inadequate Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). NBAF, which is scheduled to attain full operational capability by December 2022, will be a state-of-the-art biocontainment facility for the study of foreign, emerging, and zoonotic animal diseases that pose a threat to both U.S. animal agriculture and public health. Specific increases for research proposed in FY 2021 include: $8 million for NBAF science programs; $35 million for new initiatives relating to precision agriculture, long-term agroecosystems research, artificial intelligence, and managing excess water/controlling erosion; and $17.7 million for pay costs, performance awards, and the Federal Employees Retirement System. Offsetting the increases are $122.1 million in decreases for the (a) elimination of ongoing extramural research projects and selected intramural research projects ($74 million); (b) redirection of lower priority research projects to fund higher priority research initiatives ($35 million); and (c) one-time program transition costs associated with the transfer of operations from PIADC to NBAF which are no longer needed ($13.1 million)."

This approach will enable the United States Government to strategically allocate financial resources for these activities to best promote drug-free sport and protect the health of athletes. Consolidating this funding will enable a more rigorous review process for any proposed increases in WADA dues amounts.

","The new International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) account supports the Administration's commitment to deliver the fundamental changes needed to achieve optimal results both for affected populations and for American taxpayers. As conflict-based crises increase and force multiple displacements of populations within and outside their national borders, the 2021 Budget seeks to significantly improve our ability to respond flexibly by consolidating all overseas humanitarian assistance so that policy and implementation can be seamlessly coordinated across State and USAID to reach affected persons. Accordingly, the Budget consolidates our fragmented and outdated overseas humanitarian programming, implementation, and oversight of all implementers into one account and into the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) being stood up at USAID, in recognition of its proven expertise on effective program implementation and oversight. The ongoing merger of USAID offices into BHA demonstrates the benefits from consolidation that underpin the broader 2021 account and restructuring proposal. The Budget preserves State's lead role on foreign policy, diplomatic engagement and policy oversight of international organizations, its lead responsibilities for refugee, migration, and population policy issues, as well as the U.S. refugee admissions program (USRAP). Funding in the new IHA account will be appropriated to the President and administered by USAID under the authority of the Secretary of State. This restructuring is supported by several independent analyses and builds on State's and USAID's comparative strengths. The new account and organizational structure will enable the U.S. government to respond seamlessly to ongoing as well as new humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable displaced people, including refugees, conflict victims, stateless persons, and migrants worldwide. This restructuring is also critical to establishing a strong, single U.S. voice that can extract optimal UN reforms, to induce other donors to do their fair share, and to resolve ongoing crises. Preliminary details of this proposal, including agency lead responsibilities, were outlined in the 2020 State Congressional Budget Justification Appendix. The Budget eliminates funding for the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account and for overseas humanitarian assistance previously funded from the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account in favor of consolidated funding in the new IHA account. Programs related to U.S. refugee admissions and certain other administrative expenses will continue to be funded through the MRA account, discussed separately in the Appendix. In addition, appropriations language under the MRA account gives the Secretary of State authority to transfer funding from IHA to MRA should projected funding for refugee resettlement not be sufficient. The 2021 request also continues to eliminate the P.L. 480 Title II account. The IHA request will ensure that all food assistance programs are appropriate to local needs and will increase overall effectiveness. The 2021 Budget request enables the United States to remain the largest single humanitarian donor in the world with near-peak program levels. Specifically, these funds support all aspects of overseas humanitarian assistance, including shelter, protection, emergency health and nutrition, the provision of safe drinking water, livelihoods supports, emergency food interventions, rehabilitation, disaster risk reduction, and transition to development assistance programs. Emergency food aid can include interventions such as local and regional purchase of food near crises, the provision of U.S. commodities, food vouchers, or cash transfers, and complementary activities that support the relief, recovery, and resilience of populations affected by food crises. Funds will support the programs of international organizations, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the World Food Program (WFP), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs). When combined with carryover, the estimated average annual funding for 2020 and 2021 overseas humanitarian assistance at the IHA request level is $8.8 billion, allowing the United States to program above the second highest level ever.

The Agency has a broad mission area that includes protecting the health and value of American agricultural and natural resources that are vulnerable to pests and diseases as well as natural disasters, developing and advancing science-based standards with trading partners to ensure Americas agricultural exports are protected from unjustified restrictions, regulating genetically engineered organisms, administering the Animal Welfare Act and carrying out wildlife damage management activities.  APHIS performs this important work using three major areas of activity, as follows:Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response.--APHIS monitors animal and plant health throughout the world and uses the information to set effective agricultural import policies to prevent the introduction of foreign animal and plant pests and diseases. Should a pest or disease enter the United States, APHIS works cooperatively with Federal, State, Tribal and industry partners to rapidly diagnose them and determine if there is a need to establish new pest or disease management programs. APHIS, in conjunction with partners and stakeholders, protects American agriculture by eradicating harmful pests and diseases or, where eradication is not feasible, by minimizing their economic impact. The Agency monitors endemic pests and diseases through surveys and sampling to detect their locations and works with partners to implement controls and conduct outreach to prevent the spread of pests and diseases into non-infested parts of the country. The Agency maintains a cadre of trained professionals prepared to respond immediately to potential animal and plant health emergencies. Program personnel investigate reports of suspected presence of foreign and exotic pests and diseases and work with partners to determine an appropriate course of action, including emergency action if necessary. APHIS conducts diagnostic laboratory activities that support the Agency's animal disease and plant pest prevention, detection, control, and eradication programs. The Agency also provides and directs technology development to support animal and plant protection programs of the Agency and its cooperators at the State, Tribal, national, and international levels. APHIS provides technical and some operational assistance to States, Tribes, and local entities to reduce wildlife damage to natural and agricultural resources. Finally, the Agency protects plant health by optimizing its oversight of genetically engineered organisms.Safe Trade and International Technical Assistance.--Sanitary (animal) and phytosanitary (plant) (SPS) regulations can have a significant impact on market access for the United States as an exporter of agricultural products. The Agency participates in the development of international standards. APHIS also plays a central role in resolving technical trade issues to ensure the smooth and safe movement of agricultural commodities into and out of the United States. APHIS helps protect the United States from emerging animal and plant pests and diseases while meeting obligations under the World Trade Organization's SPS agreement by assisting developing countries in improving their protection systems. Finally, APHIS develops and implements programs designed to identify and reduce agricultural pest and disease threats while they are still outside of U.S. borders, to enhance safe agricultural trade, and to strengthen emergency response preparedness.Animal Welfare.--The Agency conducts regulatory activities to ensure the humane care and treatment of animals, including horses, as required by the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131-2159), and the Horse Protection Act of 1970 as amended (15 U.S.C. 1821-1831). These activities include inspecting certain establishments that handle animals intended for research, exhibition, and sale as pets, and monitoring of certain horse shows.APHIS' 2021 budget request is $1.033 billion. The budget continues the transition of the Agency's foreign animal disease laboratory operations from Plum Island, New York, to the new state-of-the-art National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan, Kansas. The transition will take place over several years, beginning in earnest in 2021 and continuing until NBAF is online and fully operational in December 2022. In addition, the budget includes requests for additional resources to enhance the agency's national animal disease traceability efforts, address critical staffing needs of the Center for Veterinary Biologics, and to establish a Unified Biotechnology Web-based Platform to support developers of biotechnology products.  The budget request also proposes to reduce or eliminate Federal contributions toward certain animal and plant health program efforts. APHIS works as a partner with its cooperators at the State, local, and industry levels to achieve overall program goals; the Agency expects its cooperators will increase their contributions toward these efforts. The Agency also proposes several reductions as cost savings measures.

Proposals for ERS budget priorities include research that: (1) builds on unique or confidential data sources or investments at the Federal level (2) provides coordination for a national perspective or framework; (3) requires sustained investment and large teams; (4) directly serves the U.S. Government's or USDA's long-term national goals; and (5) addresses questions with short-run payoff or that have immediate policy implications. ERS also seeks to cover the breadth of USDA programs (except forestry) and requests funding to ensure sustained expertise and to support the department through analysis of farming, commodity markets and trade, conservation, productivity growth, rural communities, food safety, food markets, and nutrition.  ERS strength in data linking, and in developing, modeling and monitoring outcome measures, including program performance and agricultural productivity growth, will contribute substantively to USDA's implementation of the Evidence Act as well as to USDA's top priority goals for Agricultural Innovation and Sustainable Agricultural Intensification.  The 2021 Budget request is $62.1 million, a decrease of $22.6 million from FY 2020. This funding level provides a framework to better streamline the Department's statistical functions and leverage administrative efficiencies. At the proposed funding level, core data expenditures, including the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and private sector commodity data and intelligence, which are foundational to this activity, will be retained. ERS will continue to provide analysis and monthly newsletters to support participation in USDA's Inter-Agency Commodity Estimate Committees (ICEC) and provide modeling and data related to USDA's Agricultural Baseline Projections. ERS will refocus and narrow its international activities to ensure continued expertise and market analysis on major agricultural trading countries such as China, Brazil and India. ERS will produce high-quality, objective measures of farm business and farm household income and wealth, cost of production for major commodities, and report on adoption of primary farm practices. ERS will continue to produce the Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Data, annual statistics to measure U.S. food security, and monthly retail food price forecasts.

As required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, this account records, for this program, the subsidy costs associated with the direct loans obligated and loan guarantees committed in 1992 and beyond (including credit sales of acquired property).

The principal objective of AbilityOne is to leverage the purchasing power of the Federal Government to provide employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities. The Commission accomplishes its mission by identifying Government procurement requirements that can create employment opportunities for individuals who are blind or have other significant disabilities. Following opportunities for public comment and after due deliberation, the Commission then places such products and service requirements on the AbilityOne Procurement List, requiring Federal departments and agencies to procure the designated products and services from a network of approximately 500 qualified State and private nonprofit agencies (NPAs) employing people who are blind or have other significant disabilities. The long-term vision of AbilityOne is to enable people who are blind or have other significant disabilities to achieve their maximum employment potential. In 2018, approximately 45,000 AbilityOne employees earned a combined total of more than $656 million in wages, with an average hourly wage of $13.72. The AbilityOne Program continues to emphasize providing employment to veterans, with more than 3,000 employed in direct labor positions. More than 1,800 AbilityOne employees moved into competitive or supported employment in 2018 after gaining skills and experience on AbilityOne jobs.While pursuing its core mission to increase employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities, the Commission is dedicated to effective stewardship and program integrity. The Commission continues to strengthen its Procurement List business processes and to enhance its oversight of AbilityOne Program participants. The resources proposed for 2021 will enable the Commission to continue implementing the requirements of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. These requirements include establishing and staffing an Office of Inspector General for the AbilityOne Program. The requirements also include establishing and administering written agreements that govern the Commission's relationship with its designated central nonprofit agencies, evaluating reports and data from such central nonprofit agencies, and maintaining the Commission's compliance and operations capacity to oversee a national program with more than $3.6 billion in annual sales of products and services to the Government."

Two statutes, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act, provide the authority for fishery disaster assistance. Under both statutes, a request for a fishery disaster determination is generally made by the Governor of a State, or an elected leader of a fishing community, although the Secretary of Commerce may also initiate a review at his or her own discretion. The Secretary determines whether the circumstances are consistent with relevant statutes and warrant a fishery disaster determination. If the Secretary determines that a fishery disaster has occurred, Congress may appropriate funds for disaster assistance, which are administered by the Secretary.NOAA intends to revise its procedures to provide greater clarity and improve consistency with respect to the process of requesting a fishery disaster declaration. These changes will accelerate the timeline for making disaster determinations and establish guidelines for administering awards. The issues to be considered include, but are not limited to, deadlines, incentives for recipients to carry insurance, required documentation of loss, cost sharing by states, other available financial assistance, eligible uses, and prioritization of the long term sustainability of the affected fishery. The changes under consideration will accelerate the Department's responsiveness to fishery disaster requests, help get appropriated funds distributed to affected communities in a more timely manner, and contribute to the long term environmental and economic sustainability of the fishery."

The following Marketing Services activities assist producers and handlers of agricultural commodities by providing a variety of marketing-related services. These services continue to become more complex as the volume of agricultural commodities increases, as greater numbers of new processed commodities are developed, and as the agricultural market structure undergoes extensive changes. Marketing changes include increased concentration in food retailing, direct buying, decentralization of processing, growth of interregional competition, vertical integration, and contract farming.

All five members of the Board are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for staggered six-year terms. The Board has two main responsibilities: 1) to analyze and review actions the executive branch takes to protect the United States from terrorism, ensuring that the need for such actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties; and 2) to ensure that liberty concerns are appropriately considered in the development and implementation of laws, regulations, and policies related to efforts to protect the Nation against terrorism. The Board is required to report semi-annually on its operations to the U.S. Congress, as well as inform the public of its activities, as appropriate."

Eisenhower Memorial Commission was created by Congress in 1999 by Public Law 106-79. The Commission's congressional mandate is to establish an appropriate, permanent national memorial to Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe in World War II and subsequently, as 34th President of the United States. The Commission's enabling legislation dictates that a memorial should be created in the nation's capital to perpetuate his memory and his contributions to the United States. The Commission is bipartisan and consists of four members of the Senate, four members of the House of Representatives, and four private citizens appointed by the President. The Commission is led by Senator Pat Roberts (Chair) and Congressman Mike Thompson (Vice Chair). Its work on building the memorial since 2001 has been informed by the active participation of the Eisenhower family, expert historians, along with input from members of Congress and federal review agencies. The memorial site, within Area 1, was approved by Congress and enacted by the President on May 5, 2006 (P.L. 109-220). Area 1 is the prominent area of the Nation's Capital reserved for memorials and monuments whose subjects are of preeminent historical and lasting significance to the United States. The memorial site is located between 4th and 6th Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C. on Independence Avenue. The Commission seeks to conduct the memorial's dedication on May 8, 2020, the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, allowing for our remaining World War II heroes to honor Eisenhower, their commander in Europe. Following the dedication, a transitionary period will occur wherein oversight of the memorial will transfer from the Commission to the National Park Service. Funds for salaries and expenses should continue through FY 2021 and remain available until expended."

Construction account funding for CERP in future years will depend on the availability of funds, so the impact of such future funding on the overall civil works program cannot be determined at this time. Funding for the Department of the Interior (DOI) includes an additional $7.8 million for work under CERP. This account also includes approximately $5.1 million for other ecosystem restoration work by the Corps in South Florida, including the Everglades ecosystem. Funding for DOI includes $45.8 million for such non-CERP work. The Budget for the two agencies includes a total of $303.5 million for ecosystem restoration work in South Florida, of which $252.7 million is for CERP and $50.9 million is for non-CERP work. (P.L. 106-541 section 601)This appropriation also funds the Corps continuing authorities programs, which involve the planning, design, and construction of smaller projects that do not require specific authorizing legislation."

The Postal Service commenced operations July 1, 1971. The Agency is charged with providing patrons with reliable mail service at reasonable rates and fees.The Postal Service is governed by an 11-member Board of Governors, including nine Governors appointed by the President, a Postmaster General who is selected by the Governors, and a Deputy Postmaster General who is selected by the Governors and the Postmaster General.Since 1971, there have been several reforms. Notably, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 moved the Postal Service ""off-budget"" so that, beginning in 1990, the receipts and disbursements of the Fund are not considered as part of the congressional and executive budget process. More recently, the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (P.L. 109-435) made a number of changes affecting the operations and oversight of the Postal Service. The Act provided for separate accounting and reporting for market-dominant products such as First-Class Mail and competitive products such as package delivery. The Act also amended the process for determining rate increases for market-dominant products, in part by imposing a limit on rate increases linked to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). In 2017, the Postal Regulatory Commission announced proposed changes to the rate structure including increases above the cap of the CPI-U. The Commission requested public comment (81 FR 95071 and 82 FR 58280) and, after additional consideration, issued a revised notice of proposed rulemaking (84 FR 67685) in December 2019.  The changes will not go into effect until after public comment and a final rule. Consequently, they are not included in the Budget's baseline for the Postal Service.P.L. 109-435 also created the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund to place the Postal Service on a path that fully funds its substantial retiree (annuitant) health benefits liabilities. This Fund was to receive from the Postal Service: 1) the pension savings provided to the Postal Service by the Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-18) that were held in escrow during 2006; 2) a 10-year stream of payments defined within P.L. 109-435 to begin the liquidation of the Postal Service's unfunded liability for post-retirement health benefits; 3) beginning in 2017, payments for the actuarial cost of Postal Service contributions for the post-retirement health benefits for its current employees; 4) beginning in 2017, a 40-year amortization payment to fund any remaining unfunded liabilities associated with post-retirement health benefits of Postal Service employees; and 5) the surplus resources of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund that are not needed to finance future retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to current or former employees of the Postal Service that are attributable to civilian employment with the Postal Service. Since passage in 2006, the Postal Service had contributed more than $50 billion to the Fund but has failed to make required payments each year since FY 2012, thus steadily increasing the size of the unfunded liability.Beginning in 2017, P.L. 109-435 also required the Postal Service to begin a 27-year amortization to retire its unfunded liability under the CSRS. The Postal Service has failed to make required payments totaling $21 billion since September 2017.  The activities of the Postal Service are financed from: 1) mail and services revenue; 2) reimbursements from Federal and non-Federal sources; 3) proceeds from borrowing; 4) interest from U.S. securities and other investments; and 5) appropriations by the Congress. All receipts and deposits are made to the Fund and are available without fiscal year limitation for payment of all expenses incurred, retirement of obligations, investment in capital assets, and investment in obligations and securities.As amended by P.L. 109-435, the Postal Service has statutory borrowing authority capped at $15 billion with the annual increase in outstanding debt limited to $3 billion. As of September 30, 2019, the total debt instruments issued and outstanding pursuant to this authority amounted to $11 billion.The Budget estimates that the Postal Service will have an annual operating deficit of $7 billion in 2020 and more than $8 billion in each subsequent year through 2030. Given the Postal Service's history of using defaults to continue operations despite losses, the Budget reflects defaults on required pension and retiree health amortization and normal cost payments to prevent the Postal Service from running unsustainable deficits.

BPA markets hydroelectric power from 21 multipurpose water resource projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and 10 projects of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, plus some energy from non-Federal generating projects in the region. These generating resources and BPA's transmission system are operated as an integrated power system with operating and financial results combined and reported as the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). BPA provides about 50 percent of the region's electric energy supply and about three-fourths of the region's high-voltage electric power transmission capacity.BPA is responsible for meeting the net firm power requirements of its requesting customers through a variety of means, including energy conservation programs, acquisition of renewable and other resources, and power exchanges with utilities both in and outside the region.BPA finances its operations with a business-type budget under the Government Corporation Control Act, 31 U.S.C. 9101-10, on the basis of the self-financing authority provided by the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974 (Transmission Act) (Public Law 93-454) and the U.S. Treasury borrowing authority provided by the Transmission Act, the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Pacific Northwest Power Act) (Public Law 96-501) for energy conservation, renewable energy resources, capital fish facilities, and other purposes, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and other legislation. Authority to borrow from the U.S. Treasury is available to the BPA on a permanent, indefinite basis. The amount of U.S. Treasury borrowing outstanding at any time cannot exceed $7.70 billion. BPA finances its approximate $4.3 billion annual cost of operations and investments primarily using power and transmission revenues and loans from the U.S. Treasury.Operating Expenses-Transmission Services.--Provides for operating over 15,000 circuit miles of high-voltage transmissions lines and 261 substations, and for maintaining the facilities and equipment of the Bonneville transmission system in 2021.Power Services.--Provides for the planning, contractual acquisition and oversight of reliable, cost effective resources. These resources are needed to serve BPA's portion of the region's forecasted net electric load requirements.

This activity provides for payment of the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs allocated to power the 31 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation hydro projects, amortization on the capital investment in power generating facilities, and irrigation assistance at U.S. Bureau of Reclamation facilities. This activity also provides for the planning, contractual acquisition and oversight of reliable, cost effective conservation. It also provides for extending the benefits of low-cost Federal power to the residential and small farm customers of investor-owned and publicly owned utilities, in accordance with the Pacific Northwest Power Act and for activities of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council required by the Pacific Northwest Power Act.Interest.--Provides for payments to the U.S. Treasury for interest on U.S. Treasury borrowings to finance BPA's capital investments under $7.70 billion of U.S. Treasury borrowing authority provided by the Transmission Act; the Pacific Northwest Power Act for energy conservation, renewable energy resources, capital fish facilities, and other purposes; the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; and other legislation. This interest category also includes interest on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, BPA and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation appropriated debt.Capital Investments--Transmission Services.--Provides for the planning, design and construction of transmission lines, substation and control system additions, replacements, and enhancements to the FCRPS transmission system for a reliable, efficient and cost-effective regional transmission system. Provides for planning, design, and construction work to repair or replace existing transmission lines, substations, control systems, and general facilities of the FCRPS transmission system.Power Services.--Provides for direct funding of additions, improvements, and replacements at existing Federal hydroelectric projects in the Northwest. It also provides for capital investments to implement environmental activities, and protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife affected by hydroelectric facilities on the Columbia River and its tributaries, in accordance with the Pacific Northwest Power Act. This activity provides for the planning, contractual acquisition and oversight of reliable, cost effective conservation.Capital Equipment/Capitalized Bond Premium.--Provides for capital information technologies, office furniture and equipment, and software capital development in support of all BPA programs. It also provides for bond premiums incurred for refinancing of bonds.Total Capital Obligations.--The 2021 capital obligations are estimated to be $799.7 million.Contingencies.--Although contingencies are not specifically funded, the need may arise to provide for purchase of power in low-water years; for repair and/or replacement of facilities affected by natural and man-made emergencies, including the resulting additional costs for contracting, construction, and operation and maintenance work; for unavoidable increased costs for the planned program due to necessary but unforeseen adjustments, including engineering and design changes, contractor and other claims and relocations; or for payment of a retrospective premium adjustment in excess nuclear property insurance.Financing.--The Transmission Act provides for the use by BPA of all receipts, collections, and recoveries in cash from all sources, including the sale of bonds, to finance the annual budget programs of BPA. These receipts result primarily from the sale of power and transmission services. The Transmission Act also provides for authority to borrow from the U.S. Treasury at rates comparable to borrowings at open market rates for similar issues. BPA has $7.70 billion of U.S. Treasury borrowing authority provided by the Transmission Act; the Pacific Northwest Power Act for energy conservation, renewable energy resources, capital fish facilities, and other purposes; the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; and other legislation. At the end of 2019, BPA had outstanding bonds with the U.S. Treasury of $5,280 million. At the end of 2019, BPA also had $7,593.3 million of non-Federal debt outstanding, including Energy Northwest bonds. BPA will rely primarily on its U.S. Treasury borrowing authority to finance capital projects, but may also elect to use cash reserves generated by revenues from customers or seek third party financing sources when feasible to finance some of these investments.In 2019, BPA made payments to the Treasury of $1,064 million and also expects to make payments of $624 million in 2020 and $689 million in 2021. The 2021 payment is expected to be distributed as follows: interest on bonds and appropriations ($232 million), amortization ($402 million), and other ($55 million). BPA also received credits totaling approximately $124 million applied against its Treasury payments in 2019 to reflect amounts diverted to fish mitigation efforts, but not allocable to power, in the Columbia and Snake River systems.BPA, with input from its stakeholders, considers other strategies to sustain funding for its infrastructure investment requirements as well. BPA's Financial Plan defines strategies and policies for guiding how BPA will manage risk and variability of electricity markets and water years. It also describes how BPA will continue to manage to ensure it meets its Treasury repayment responsibilities.Direct Loans.--During 2021, no new direct loan obligations may be made.Operating Results.--Total revenues are forecast at approximately $3.9 billion in 2021.It should be noted that BPA's revenue forecasts are based on several critical assumptions about both the supply of and demand for Federal energy. During the operating year, deviation from the conditions assumed in a rate case may result in a variation in actual revenues of several hundred million dollars from the forecast.Consistent with Administration policy, BPA will continue to fully recover, from the sale of electric power and transmission, funds sufficient to cover the full cost of Civil Service Retirement System and Post-Retirement Health Benefits for its employees. The entire cost of BPA and the power share of FCRPS U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation employees working under the Federal Employees Retirement System is fully recovered in wholesale electric power and transmission rates."

The Federal crop insurance program includes products providing crop yield and revenue insurance, pasture, rangeland forage, and livestock insurance, as well as other educational and risk mitigation initiatives/tools. The Federal crop insurance program provides farmers with a risk management program that protects against agricultural production losses due to natural disasters such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, lightning, and insects. In addition to these causes, revenue insurance programs are available to protect against loss of revenue. Federal crop insurance is available for more than 350 different commodities in over 3,066 counties covering all 50 states, and Puerto Rico. For the 2019 Crop Year, there were 1.1 million policies written with $10.1. billion in premiums. Federal crop insurance policies are sold and serviced by 14 private crop insurance companies that share in the risk on the policies they sell under terms set out by USDA's Standard Reinsurance Agreement. The risk sharing is designed to be in favor of the companies, not one for one with the government. In most years the companies realize underwriting gains. In bad years, the companies' underwriting losses are minimalized because the government takes on more of the risk and ultimately back-stops the program after a certain level of loss. Currently, the government provides companies, on average, $1.1 billion a year in underwriting gains. In addition, the government pays the companies an Administrative and Operating (A&amp;O) subsidy to offset the costs incurred to carry out the program. They are reimbursed on average for about 14.5 percent of the premiums sold. The government currently pays $1.5 billion annually for A&amp;O. For the 2021 Budget, the payments to the companies are projected to be $2.7 billion in combined A&amp;O subsidy and underwriting gains. The 2021 Budget requests $8.7 billion in direct mandatory funding. Funding estimates for 2020 and 2021 as well as the outyears are based on a 1.0 loss ratio, which is the statutory target loss ratio used for estimating future crop insurance costs. The minimum level of coverage is Catastrophic (CAT) crop insurance, which compensates the farmer for losses exceeding 50 percent of the individual's average yield at 55 percent of the expected market price; the premium is entirely subsidized. The cost to the producer for CAT coverage is an annual administrative fee of $655 per crop per county. Additional coverage is available to producers and is commonly referred to as ""buy-up"" coverage. Policyholders can elect to be paid up to 100 percent of the market price established by FCIC for each unit of production their actual yield is less than the individual yield guarantee. Premium rates for additional coverage depend on the level of protection selected and vary from crop to crop and county to county. They also depend on the producer's average production history (APH). Producers are assessed a fee of $30 per crop, per county, in addition to a share of the premium. The additional levels of insurance coverage are more attractive to farmers due to availability of optional units, other policy provisions not available with CAT coverage, and the ability to obtain a level of protection that permits them to use crop insurance as loan collateral and to achieve greater financial security. Revenue protection for specified products is provided by extending traditional crop insurance protection, based on actual production history, to include price variability based on futures market prices. Producers have a choice of revenue protection (protection against loss of revenue caused by low prices, low yields, or a combination of both) or yield protection (protection for production losses only) within one Basic Provision and the applicable Crop Provision. Currently for revenue protection, the farmer can opt to cover the projected or the harvest price. Traditional revenue insurance only protects against a projected price, where the farmer is guaranteed a price at the time of planting. Revenue coverage that protects the price at the time of harvest guarantees the price to the farmer for the higher of the projected price or the harvest price. This additional revenue protection allows farmers to hedge against low prices at harvest. The harvest price protection policies are more costly than traditional revenue coverage and therefore more heavily subsidized by the government. Almost all farmers choose the harvest price option because taxpayers pay such a large portion of the extra premium. A crop insurance policy also contains coverage for when a producer is prevented from planting their crop due to weather and other perils. When an insured producer is unable to plant their crop within the planting time period because of excessive drought or moisture, they may file a prevented planting claim, which pays a portion of their full coverage level. It is optional for the producer to plant a second crop on the acres. If the producer does, the prevented planting claim on the first crop is reduced and the producer's APH is updated to incorporate that year. If the producer does not plant a second crop, they get their full prevented planting claim, and their APH is not affected in subsequent years for premium calculation purposes.  Financing.--The Corporation is authorized under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended, to use funds from the issuance of capital stock which provides working capital for the Corporation. Receipts, which are for deposit to this fund, mainly come from premiums paid by farmers. The principal payments from this fund are for indemnities to insured farmers, and administrative expenses for approved insurance providers. Premium subsidies are authorized by section 508(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended, and are received through appropriations. "

The TVA Act sets forth the agency's purpose: to address the Valley's most important issues in energy, environmental stewardship, and economic development. TVA is currently self-funded, financing its operations almost entirely from revenues and power system financings.TVA's Non-Power Programs.--TVA operates a series of 49 dams and 47 reservoirs to reduce the risk of flooding, enable year-round navigation, supply affordable and reliable electricity, improve water quality and water supply, provide recreational opportunities, stimulate economic growth, and provide other public benefits. TVA is responsible for stewardship activities within the Tennessee Valley that include: water release regulation; maintenance of dam machinery and spillway gates; modifications on nine main and four auxiliary navigation locks and associated mooring facilities; improvement of water quality and supply; management of shoreline erosion; regulation of shoreline development along the Tennessee River and its tributaries; planning and management of 293,000 acres of public land; and operation of public recreation areas. These services are funded entirely by TVA's power revenues and its user fees.TVA's Power Program.--TVA supplies electric power to an area of 80,000 square miles covering parts of the seven Tennessee Valley states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Estimated income from power operations, net of interest charges, depreciation, and other operating expenses, is expected to be $1.6 billion in 2021 on operating revenues of $10.7 billion. Power generating facilities are financed from power revenues and power system financings. TVA's power system financings consist primarily of the sale of debt securities and secondarily of alternative forms of financing, such as lease arrangements.TVA Policy Initiatives.--Currently, TVA is well-positioned to meet or exceed its $22 billion debt objective by 2023, established during the 2014 planning cycle, due to the successful execution of cost-savings initiatives as well as strong financial performance to date. As a result, TVA has elected to forego an 2020 base rate action and does not anticipate implementing any near-term rate actions in order to achieve this 2023 debt goal. As part of the aforementioned cost-saving initiative, TVA established a goal of reducing annual operating costs by $500 million relative to the 2013 budget. TVA exceeded this goal by approximately $300 million, for a total reduction of $800 million, and is committed to future continuous improvement initiatives. Additionally, TVA's rate position compared to peers has improved since embarking on the strategic debt reduction plan. Strategic Financial Plan.--In August 2019, the TVA Board approved an annual budget that reflects the first year of a new Strategic Financial Plan. The Strategic Financial Plan, which extends from 2020 through 2030, is flexible in aligning customer preferences and TVA's mission while at the same time establishing a forecast of financial results. Key focus areas of the Strategic Financial Plan include (1) establishing better alignment between the length of local power company (LPC) contracts and TVA's long-term commitments, (2) stabilizing debt in an $18-$20 billion range, (3) maintaining rates as low as feasible, (4) maintaining current levels of cash, and (5) pursuing operational efficiencies. Long-term power planning requires TVA to make long-term financial commitments. As of October 1, 2018, the weighted average length of the notice period under TVA's wholesale power contracts with LPCs was less than 7 years. TVA measures the alignment between its committed revenues and total obligations through a measure known as Net Portfolio Position. In order to better align customer contractual commitments with TVA's overall financial obligations, a long-term partnership proposal was made available to TVA's 154 LPCs on August 22, 2019, after Board approval. Under this long-term partnership proposal, LPCs that agree to contractual changes, which include a rolling 20-year term and a termination notice period of 20 years, will receive a long-term partner credit. That credit is currently 3.1% of wholesale standard service demand, energy, and grid access charges. TVA's effective wholesale rate and annual revenues will decline as LPCs commit to becoming long-term partners, but TVA's overall financial health will improve through better alignment of customer contract terms with TVA's overall financial obligations. As part of the agreement, TVA has also committed to providing enhanced power supply flexibility for 3-5% of LPC energy by October 1, 2021, with pricing and planning considerations mutually agreeable between the LPC and TVA. As of December 31, 2019, 134 of the 154 LPCs served by TVA have signed the long-term partnership proposal, thus closing the gap between TVA's committed revenues and long-term obligations.TVA continues to make decisions to move toward an optimized generation fleet as an important part of improving operational performance. TVA has been working for several years toward a more balanced portfolio to provide greater flexibility to generate cleaner, low-cost energy more efficiently from a variety of fuel sources.During 2017, TVA began commercial operations of a new gas-fired facility at the Paradise Fossil Plant site. Following the completion of this facility, TVA retired Paradise coal-fired units 1 and 2 effective April 2017. The Board voted at its February 2019 meeting to retire Paradise Fossil Unit 3 by December 2020 and to retire Bull Run Fossil Plant by December 2023 in order to maintain a low-cost and efficient generating fleet. Subsequent to the Board approval, TVA determined that Paradise would not be restarted after January 2020 due to the plant's material condition.  Current operations indicate the plant may continue to run into the second quarter of 2020.  Moreover, as part of its efforts to maintain a well-balanced nuclear portfolio, TVA successfully implemented an extended power uprate project at all three units of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant by the end of 2019. As of September 30, 2019, physical work on all units was complete and the generation capacity is expected to increase 465 MW after sufficient run time to validate the new capacity.Economic Development.--TVA is charged with providing the people of the Tennessee Valley region greater opportunities for prosperity. To that end, TVA works to foster capital investment and job growth in the Valley in collaboration with regional, state and local organizations. In fiscal year 2019, TVA worked in partnership with communities and the business sector to spur $8.9 billion in capital investment in the Tennessee Valley region and helped attract and retain approximately 66,500 jobs.Financing.--Amounts estimated to become available for TVA programs in 2021 are to be derived from operating revenues of $10.7 billion. The outstanding balance of TVA's bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtedness is limited by statute and cannot exceed $30 billion. TVA's outstanding debt and debt-like obligations were $22.8 billion at the beginning of 2020 and are estimated to be $21.3 billion by the end of 2021. At the beginning of 2020, TVA had $1.5 billion in debt-like obligations that are not counted against its statutory debt cap. In addition, TVA had an unfunded pension liability of $5.3 billion as of September 30, 2019.Operating results and financial conditions.--Payments to the Treasury from power proceeds in 2021 are estimated at a $7 million return on the appropriation investment in the power program. Total capital spending for 2021 is estimated at $2.4 billion, which in addition to new generation capacity includes approximately $200 million for environmental projects and $1.1 billion to maintain TVA's existing generation assets. Total government equity at September 30, 2021, is estimated to be $1.6 billion more than that at September 30, 2020. This change includes the estimated net income from power operations and payments to the Treasury. As of September 30, 2019, the funding status of TVA employees' defined benefit pension plan (TVARS) was that of a 60% funding ratio and a $5.3 billion unfunded liability. This compares to a 68% funding ratio and $3.7 billion unfunded liability in 2018, and a 63% funding ratio and $4.6 billion unfunded liability in 2017.  The decrease in funding ratio and increase in unfunded liability in 2019 was caused by a decrease in the liability discount rate. TVA contributed $300 million to TVARS, and incurred $303 million in actuarial costs in 2019. TVA also made $721 million in payments to beneficiaries and earned $389 million, or a 5.5 percent rate of return, on the plan's investments in 2019. TVA is committed to meeting its obligations to current and future retirees and has worked with the TVARS Board in recent years to implement several significant changes to ensure the long-term health of the retirement system."

Since 1996, the Mint's operations have been funded through the Public Enterprise Fund (PEF) established by section 522 of Public Law 104-52 (31 U.S.C. 5136). The operations of the Mint are divided into two major components, circulating coinage and numismatic products. Finances for the two components are accounted for separately; Receipts from circulating coinage operations are not used to fund numismatic operations and receipts from numismatic operations are not used to fund circulating coinage operations. The Mint generates revenue through the issuance of circulating coins to the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs) and the sale of numismatic products to the public and bullion coins to authorized purchasers. The Mint submits annual audited financial statements to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the Congress in support of the operations of the PEF. In 2019, the Mint transferred $540 million to the General Fund.Circulating Coinage. This activity funds the minting and issuance of circulating coins to the FRBs in amounts that the Secretary of the Treasury determines are necessary to meet the needs of the United States. The 2021 Budget reflects production volumes that correspond to expected demand and raw materials costs, which are driven by commodity prices and volumes. The Mint receives funds from the Federal Reserve equal to the face value of the circulating coins shipped to the FRB. The Mint is credited with the full cost of producing and distributing the coins that are put into circulation, including the depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment. The difference between the face value of the coins and the full cost of producing the coins is called seigniorage, which is a means of financing the deficit and transferred periodically to the General Fund. The annual appropriations bill includes a statutory cap on Mint expenditures on circulating and protection capital investments. The cap for 2021 is $50 million.Numismatic Items. This activity funds the manufacturing of numismatic items, which include collectible coins and sets, medals, bullion coins, and other products for sale to collectors and other members of the public who desire high-quality or investment-grade versions of the Nation's coinage. These products include annual proof and uncirculated sets; investment-grade silver and gold bullion coins; uncirculated silver and gold coins; proof silver, gold, platinum and palladium coins; and commemorative coins and medals that are authorized to commemorate events, individuals, places, or other subjects. Prices for numismatic products are based on the estimated product cost plus a reasonable margin to assure that the numismatic program operates at no net cost to the taxpayer. Similarly, bullion coins are priced based on the market price of the precious metals plus a premium to cover manufacturing, marketing, and distribution costs. Making numismatic products accessible, available, and affordable to Americans who choose to purchase them is the highest priority of the Mint's numismatic operations."

It guarantees payment of basic pension benefits earned by over 35,000,000 of America's workers and retirees participating in more than 25,000 private-sector defined benefit pension plans.  The Single-Employer Program protects about 24,700,000 workers and retirees in about 24,000 pension plans. The Multiemployer Program protects about 10,800,000 workers and retirees in about 1,400 pension plans. The Corporation receives no funds from general tax revenues. Operations are financed by insurance premiums set by Congress and paid by sponsors of defined benefit plans, investment income, assets from pension plans trusteed by PBGC, and recoveries from the companies formerly responsible for the plans.  PBGC is requesting $465,289,000 in spending authority for administrative purposes in 2021. The request includes spending authority of $5,000,000 for the Pension Insurance Modeling System (PIMS) transformation and budget forecasting tool; $2,000,000 for eBusiness Suite upgrades; $5,061,000 for mission critical and mandatory personnel compensation and benefit costs; and an additional $370,000 for the Office of the Inspector General's financial statement audit, cybersecurity posture, and Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency annual fee.  This request proposes language in the General Provisions of the President's Budget to provide reception and representation authority up to $5,000.Plan Preservation Efforts.--PBGC works to preserve plans and keep pension promises in the hands of the employers who make them. When companies undertake major transactions that might threaten their ability to pay pensions, PBGC negotiates protections for their pension plans. Last year, PBGC worked with dozens of companies, both in bankruptcy and otherwise, to preserve their plans that were at risk. In 2019, PBGC:--Paid $160,000,000 in financial assistance to 89 insolvent multiemployer plans, including four plans that were closed out by annuity purchases; and--Performed audits of eight multiemployer plans covering more than 10,000 people to evaluate the timeliness and accuracy of benefit payments to all participants, compliance with laws and regulations, and the effectiveness and efficiency in management of the remaining assets in terminated and insolvent plans.Stepping in to Insure Pensions When Plans Fail.--When plans do fail, PBGC steps in to ensure that basic benefits continue to be paid. Over the years, PBGC has become responsible for almost 1,500,000 people in more than 4,900 failed plans. In 2019, PBGC:--Paid $6,020,000,000 in benefits to 932,000 retirees in single-employer plans; and-- Performed standard termination audits of single-employer plans that resulted in additional payments of $5,100,000 to 993 people.Single-employer benefit payments.-- Through its Single-Employer Program, PBGC is directly responsible for the benefits of about 1,500,000 current and future retirees in trusteed pension plans.  The Single-Employer Program covers defined benefit pension plans that generally are sponsored by a single employer.  When an underfunded single-employer plan terminates, PBGC steps in to pay participants' benefits up to legal limits set by law.  This typically happens when the employer sponsoring an underfunded plan goes bankrupt, ceases operation, or can no longer afford to keep the plan going.  PBGC takes over the plan's assets, administration, and payment of benefits up to the legal limits.  In some instances, plans can choose to voluntarily terminate by filing a standard termination if the plan has enough money to pay all benefits owed to participants.  In FY 2019, PBGC:  - Took responsibility for 51 single-employer plans that provide the pension benefits to more than 103,000 current and future retirees; - Oversaw the seamless transition of more than 15,000 retirees to direct payments from PBGC.  Multiemployer financial assistance.--The Multiemployer Program covers about 10,800,000 participants in about 1,400 insured plans.  A multiemployer plan is a pension plan sponsored by two or more unrelated employers under collective bargaining agreements with one or more unions.  Multiemployer plans cover most unionized workers in the trucking, retail food, construction, mining, garment, and other industries.  If a PBGC-insured multiemployer plan is unable to pay guaranteed benefits when due, PBGC provides insolvent multiemployer plans with financial assistance, in the statutorily required form of loans, sufficient to pay PBGC guaranteed benefits and reasonable administrative expenses.Investment management fees.--PBGC contracts with professional financial services corporations to manage Trust Fund assets in accordance with an investment strategy approved by PBGC's Board of Directors. Investment management fees are driven by the amount of assets under management. They are a direct, programmatic expense required to maintain the Trust Fund which supports single-employer benefit payments.Consolidated Administrative Budget.--PBGC's administrative budget comprises all expenditures and operations that support:--Benefit payments to pension plan participants;--Financial assistance to distressed multiemployer pension plans; and--Stewardship and accountability.These operations include premium collections, pre-trusteeship work, efforts to preserve pension plans, recovery of assets from former plan sponsors, and pension insurance program protection activities. This area also covers the expenditures that support activities related to trusteeship; plan asset management (excluding investment management fees) and trust accounting; as well as benefit payments and administration services. Finally, this area includes the administrative functions covering procurement, financial management, human resources, facilities management, communications, legal support, and information technology infrastructure. These funds support the operations of the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. They also support the required functions and efforts of the Office of the Inspector General, including training and participation in the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) activities."

Flood insurance is available to homeowners and businesses in communities that have adopted and enforce appropriate floodplain management measures. Coverage is limited to buildings and their contents. At the end of 2019, the program had approximately 5.1 million policies in more than 22,200 communities with approximately $1.31 trillion of insurance in force.The program uses a multi-pronged strategy for reducing future flood damage. The NFIP offers flood mitigation assistance grants to assist flood victims to rebuild to current building codes, including higher base flood elevations, thereby reducing future flood damage. In addition, flood mitigation assistance grants targeted toward repetitive and severe repetitive loss properties not only help owners of high-risk property, but also reduce the disproportionate drain on the National Flood Insurance Fund these properties cause, through acquisition, relocation, or elevation. FEMA works to ensure that the flood mitigation grant program is closely integrated with other FEMA mitigation grant programs, resulting in better coordination and communication with State and local governments. Further, through the Community Rating System, FEMA adjusts premium rates to encourage community and State mitigation activities beyond those required by the NFIP. A 2014 study shows these efforts, in addition to the minimum NFIP requirements for floodplain management, can save over $1.9 billion annually in avoided flood claims.In 2021, FEMA continues to put the NFIP on a more sustainable financial footing moving forward by signaling to homeowners the true cost associated with living in a floodplain through premium increases for policyholders paying premiums that are less than full risk."

The 2018 Farm Bill repealed certain programs, continued some programs with modifications, and authorized several new programs. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), Public Law 115-123, provides assistance to producers impacted by specific hurricanes in 2017, and made changes to the CCC commodity and disaster programs. BUDGET ASSUMPTIONSThe estimates for CCC spending in 2019 and 2020 reflect expenditures related to the trade damage mitigation programs and other CCC activities not described in this narrative, as well as commodity and conservation programs authorized under the 2018 Farm Bill. The budget estimates for 2021 decrease significantly from 2020 levels, because of lower trade mitigation program expenditures that are slightly offset by additional expenditures reflecting new 2018 Farm Bill provisions. Outlay projections are subject to complex and unpredictable factors such as weather; U.S. and world consumer income growth; factors which affect the volume of production of crops not yet planted; demands for feed, food, and bio-energy here and overseas; and foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar overall. PROGRAMS FOR COMMODITY CROPSPrice support, marketing assistance loans, and related stabilization programs.--As authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, the Corporation conducts programs to support farm income and prices and stabilize the market for agricultural commodities. Price support is provided to producers of agricultural commodities through loans, purchases, payments, and other means.Price support is mandatory for sugar. Marketing assistance loans are mandatory for wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, upland cotton, peanuts, rice, pulse crops, sugar, honey, wool, mohair, and extra-long staple cotton.One method of providing support is loans to and purchases from producers. With limited exceptions, loans made on commodities are nonrecourse. The commodities serve as collateral for the loan and on maturity the producer may deliver or forfeit such collateral to satisfy the loan obligation without further payment.Direct purchases may be made from processors as well as producers, depending on the commodity involved. Also, purchases are made under various laws; for example, the Act of August 19, 1958, as amended, and section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended.Commodity Payment Programs.--Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) payments are available for a wide variety of commodity crops.  The BBA added seed cotton as a covered commodity eligible for ARC and PLC. The BBA also removed generic base acres beginning with the 2018 crop year, and allowed producers to reallocate generic base acres to seed cotton, or other covered commodities eligible for ARC/PLC payments.Price Loss Coverage (PLC).--Payments are issued when the effective price of a covered commodity is less than the respective reference price for that commodity established in the statute. The payment is equal to 85 percent of the base acres of the covered commodity times the difference between the effective reference price and the effective price times the program payment yield for the covered commodity. The 2018 Farm Bill authorized a nationwide PLC yield update for the 2020 crop year.Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC).--There are two types: County ARC and Individual ARC.County ARC: Payments are issued when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is less than the ARC county guarantee for the covered commodity and are based on county data, not farm data. The ARC county guarantee equals 86 percent of the previous 5-year average national farm price, excluding the years with the highest and lowest price (the ARC guarantee price), times the 5-year average county yield, excluding the years with the highest and lowest yield (the ARC county guarantee yield). Both the guarantee and actual revenue are computed using base acres, not planted acres. The payment is equal to 85 percent of the base acres of the covered commodity times the difference between the county guarantee and the actual county crop revenue for the covered commodity. Payments may not exceed 10 percent of the benchmark county revenue (the ARC guarantee price times the ARC county guarantee yield).Individual ARC: Payments are issued when the actual individual crop revenues, summed across all covered commodities on the farm, are less than ARC individual guarantees summed across those covered commodities on the farm. The farm for individual ARC purposes is the sum of the producer's interest in all ARC farms in the State. The farm's ARC individual guarantee equals 86 percent of the farm's individual benchmark guarantee, which is defined as the ARC guarantee price times the 5-year average individual yield, excluding the years with the highest and lowest yields, and summing across all crops on the farm. The actual revenue is computed in a similar fashion, with both the guarantee and actual revenue computed using planted acreage on the farm. The individual ARC payment equals: a) 65 percent of the sum of the base acres of all covered commodities on the farm, times b) the difference between the individual guarantee revenue and the actual individual crop revenue across all covered commodities planted on the farm. Payments may not exceed 10 percent of the individual benchmark revenue.Election Required.--All of the producers on a farm must make an election of: 1) PLC/County ARC on a covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis; or 2) Individual ARC for all covered commodities on the farm. If the producers on the farm elect PLC/County ARC, the producers must also make a one-time election to select which base acres on the farm are enrolled in PLC and which base acres are enrolled in County ARC. Alternatively, if Individual ARC is selected, then every covered commodity on the farm must participate in Individual ARC. The 2018 Farm Bill authorized an annual election opportunity beginning in crop year 2021, with an initial election opportunity in 2019 for both the 2019 and 2020 crop years. Also, authorization for ARC and PLC was extended through the 2023 crop year.Adjusted Gross Income.--Adjusted gross income (AGI) provisions have been simplified and modified. Producers whose average AGI exceeds $900,000 during a crop, fiscal, or program year are not eligible to participate in most programs administered by FSA and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previous AGI provisions distinguished between farm and nonfarm AGI.Payment Limitations.--The total amount of payments received, directly and indirectly, by a person or legal entity (except joint ventures or general partnerships) for Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage (other than for peanuts), may not exceed $125,000 per crop year. A person or legal entity that receives payments for peanuts has a separate $125,000 payment limitation. For the Supplemental Disaster Programs, a payment limit of $125,000 applies to payments under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP). The 2018 Farm Bill eliminated the payment limit for Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 eliminated the payment limits for Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) and the Tree Assistance Program (TAP).Marketing Assistance Loans (MALs) and Sugar Loans.--The 2018 Farm Bill extends the authority for sugar loans for the 2019 through 2023 crop years and nonrecourse marketing assistance loans (MALs) and loan deficiency payment (LDPs) for the 2019-2023 crops of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, extra-long staple cotton (eligible for loans only), long grain rice, medium grain rice, soybeans, other oilseeds (including sunflower seed, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, crambe and sesame seed), dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, large chickpeas, graded and nongraded wool, mohair, honey, unshorn pelts, and peanuts. Availability of loans for some commodities may be affected by appropriations language. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-113) amended the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, allowing producers to receive certificates in lieu of marketing loan gains or loan deficiency payments starting with the 2015 crop marketing year.DAIRY PROGRAMSDairy Margin Coverage.--The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, which is a voluntary risk management program for dairy producers. The program provides payments to dairy producers when the difference between the all milk price and the average feed price (the margin) falls below a margin selected by the producer. Catastrophic coverage is available at no cost to the producers, other than an annual $100 administrative fee; and various levels of buy-up coverage that farmers may choose by paying premiums covering the dairy operation's production history, ranging from 5 percent to 95 percent of production.Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP).--The program provides payments to dairy producers when a public regulatory agency directs them to remove their raw milk from the commercial market because it has been contaminated by pesticides and other residues.PROGRAMS FOR BIOENEGY AND NON-COMMODITY CROPS Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP).--NAP provides coverage, similar to buy-up provisions offered under the Federal crop insurance program. Producers may elect coverage for each individual crop between 50 and 65 percent of production, in 5 percent increments, at 100 percent of the average market price. Producers also pay a fixed premium equal to 5.25 percent of the liability. The waiver of service fees has been expanded from just limited resource farmers to also include beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers. The premiums for buy-up coverage are reduced by 50 percent for those same farmers.Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP).--BCAP provides incentives to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to establish, cultivate and harvest eligible biomass for heat, power, bio-based products, research and advanced biofuels. Crop producers and bioenergy facilities can team together to submit proposals to USDA for selection as a BCAP project area. The 2018 Farm Bill did provide an authorization to spend up to $25 million annually through FY 2023 but changed the funding source from CCC mandatory funds to discretionary funds subject to annual appropriation.Feedstock Flexibility Program (FFP).--FFP is continued through fiscal year 2023. Congress authorized the FFP in the 2008 Farm Bill, allowing for the purchase of sugar to be sold for the production of bioenergy in order to avoid forfeitures of sugar loan collateral under the Sugar Program.DISASTER PROGRAMSThe following four disaster programs were authorized by the 2008 Farm Bill under the USDA Supplemental Disaster Assistance Program. These programs were permanently re-authorized under CCC in the 2014 Farm Bill and modified in the 2018 Farm Bill.Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP).--LFP provides compensation to eligible livestock producers that have suffered grazing losses due to drought or fire on land that is native or improved pastureland with permanent vegetative cover or that is planted specifically for grazing. LFP payments for drought are equal to 60 percent of the monthly feed cost for up to 5 months, depending upon the severity of the drought. LFP payments for fire on federally managed rangeland are equal to 50 percent of the monthly feed cost for the number of days the producer is prohibited from grazing the managed rangeland, not to exceed 180 calendar days.Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP).--LIP provides benefits to livestock producers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality caused by adverse weather or by attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the Federal Government. LIP payments are equal to 75 percent of the average fair market value of the livestock. The BBA removed the payment limit for LIP and added provisions to provide benefits for the sale of animals at a reduced price if the sale occurred due to injury that was a direct result of an eligible adverse weather event or due to an attack by an animal reintroduced into the wild.Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish (ELAP).--ELAP provides emergency assistance to eligible producers of livestock, honeybees and farm-raised fish for losses due to disease (including cattle tick fever), adverse weather, or other conditions, such as blizzards and wildfires, not covered by LFP and LIP. The BBA removed the annual funding limitation of $20 million per program year and clarified which losses are eligible for assistance. The 2018 Farm Bill eliminated the payment limit for ELAP.Tree Assistance Program (TAP).--TAP provides financial assistance to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters. The BBA removed the payment limitation for TAP and increased the number of acres for which a producer can receive payment from 500 to 1,000 acres per year. In addition, the BBA expanded coverage under TAP by providing $15 million for 2017 pecan tree losses for growers who suffered a pecan mortality loss that exceeds 7.5 percent (rather than a mortality loss that exceeds 15 percent) due to an eligible natural disaster.FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMSMarket Access Program (MAP).--Under the MAP, CCC Funds are used to reimburse participating organizations for a portion of the costs of carrying out overseas marketing and promotional activities. The 2018 Farm Bill continues the authority for the MAP program with annual funding of $200 million for 2018-2023.Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program (FMD) and Quality Samples Program.--Under the FMD program, cost-share assistance is provided to nonprofit commodity and agricultural trade associations to support overseas market development activities that are designed to remove long-term impediments to increased U.S. trade. CCC will fund the Quality Samples Program at an authorized annual level of $2.5 million. Under this initiative, samples of U.S. agricultural products will be provided to foreign importers to promote a better understanding and appreciation for the high quality of U.S. products.Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops and Emerging Markets.--Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops and Emerging Markets were both extended through 2023 in the 2018 Farm Bill. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust.--The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a commodity and/or monetary reserve designed to ensure that the United States can meet its international food aid commitments. Assets of the Trust can be released any time the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development determines that PL 480 Title II is inadequate to meet those needs in any fiscal year. When a release from the Trust is authorized, the Trust's assets cover all commodity costs associated with the release. All non-commodity costs, including ocean freight charges; internal transportation, handling, and storage overseas; and certain administrative costs are paid by CCC. The 2018 Farm Bill extends the authorization to replenish the BEHT through 2023.CONSERVATION PROGRAMSConservation Reserve Program (CRP).--The 2018 Farm Bill extended and modified the authorization of CRP through FY 2023. It limits the practice incentive payments to the actual cost of practice implementation and lowers the CRP soil rental payments to 85 percent of the rental rate for general program enrollment and 90 percent for continuous program enrollment. The acreage cap is increased from 24 million acres to 27 million acres by FY 2023. The 2018 Farm Bill also authorized up to $12 million in incentive payments for tree thinning and related activities.Transition Incentive Program (TIP).--The 2018 Farm Bill extended TIP through FY 2023. It authorized up to $50 million to encourage the transition of expiring CRP land to a beginning, socially disadvantaged, or veteran farmer or rancher so land can be returned to sustainable grazing or crop production.OPERATING EXPENSESThe Corporation carries out its functions through utilization of employees and facilities of other Government agencies. Administrative expenses are incurred by: the Farm Service Agency (FSA); the Foreign Agricultural Service; the Natural Resources Conservation Service; other agencies of the Department engaged in the Corporation's activities; and the Office of Inspector General for audit functions.  The table below summarizes some of the administrative expenses funded through the Corporation.  These funds are in addition to discretionary appropriations for these agencies.

These expenses are treated as program expenses. Such program expenses include inspection, classing, and grading work performed on a fee basis by Federal employees or Federal- or State-licensed inspectors; and special services performed by Federal agencies within and outside this Department. Most of these general expenses, including storage and handling, transportation, inspection, classing and grading, and producer storage payments, are included in program costs. They are shown in the program and financing schedule in the entries entitled ""Storage, transportation, and other obligations not included above.''Section 161 of the 1996 Act amended Section 11 of the CCC Charter Act to limit the use of CCC funds for the transfer and allotment of funds to State and Federal agencies. The Section 11 cap of $56 million remains in 2020 and 2021.The Corporation receives reimbursement for grain requisitioned pursuant to Public Law 87-152 by the States from Corporation stocks to feed resident wildlife threatened with starvation through the appropriation reimbursement for net realized losses. There have been no requisitions in recent years, however. The Corporation receives reimbursement for the commodity costs and other costs, including administrative costs, for commodities supplied to domestic nutrition programs and international food aid programs.FINANCINGAppropriations.--Reimbursement for Net Realized Losses. Under Section 2 of Public Law 87-155, the Act of August 17 1961 (15 U.S.C. 713a 11), annual appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year, commencing with 1961, to reimburse the Corporation for net realized losses. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 amended Public Law 87-155 to authorize that the Corporation is reimbursed for its net realized losses by means of a current, indefinite appropriation as provided in annual appropriations acts. Appropriations to the Corporation for net realized losses have no effect on budget authority, as they are used to repay debt directly with the Treasury.Borrowing authority.--The Corporation has an authorized capital stock of $100 million held by the U.S. Treasury and, effective in 1988, authority to have outstanding borrowings up to $30 billion at any one time. Funds are borrowed from the Treasury and may also be borrowed from private lending agencies and others. The Corporation reserves a sufficient amount of its borrowing authority to purchase at any time all notes and other obligations evidencing loans made to the Corporation by such agencies and others. All bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations issued by the Corporation are subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury as required by the Act of March 8, 1938.Interest on borrowings from the Treasury (and on capital stock) is paid at a rate based upon the average interest rate of all outstanding marketable obligations (of comparable maturity date) of the United States as of the preceding month. Interest is also paid on other notes and obligations at a rate prescribed by the Corporation and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1966, made provision for terminating interest after June 30, 1964 on the portion of the Corporation's borrowings from the Treasury equal to the unreimbursed realized losses recorded on the books of the Corporation after the end of the fiscal year in which such losses are realized.Non-Expenditure Transfers.--The Commodity Credit Corporation transfers CCC funds to several agencies responsible for administering Farm Bill and other Corporation programs. Once transferred, the expenses are recorded in the receiving agencies accounts."

The 2018 Farm Bill repealed certain programs, continued some programs with modifications, and authorized several new programs. In addition, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), Public Law 115-123, provides assistance to producers impacted by specific hurricanes in 2017, and made changes to the CCC commodity and disaster programs. BUDGET ASSUMPTIONSThe estimates for CCC spending in 2019 and 2020 reflect expenditures related to the trade damage mitigation programs and other CCC activities not described in this narrative, as well as commodity and conservation programs authorized under the 2018 Farm Bill. The budget estimates for 2021 decrease significantly from 2020 levels, because of lower trade mitigation program expenditures that are slightly offset by additional expenditures reflecting new 2018 Farm Bill provisions. Outlay projections are subject to complex and unpredictable factors such as weather; U.S. and world consumer income growth; factors which affect the volume of production of crops not yet planted; demands for feed, food, and bio-energy here and overseas; and foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar overall. PROGRAMS FOR COMMODITY CROPSPrice support, marketing assistance loans, and related stabilization programs.--As authorized in the 2018 Farm Bill, the Corporation conducts programs to support farm income and prices and stabilize the market for agricultural commodities. Price support is provided to producers of agricultural commodities through loans, purchases, payments, and other means.Price support is mandatory for sugar. Marketing assistance loans are mandatory for wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, upland cotton, peanuts, rice, pulse crops, sugar, honey, wool, mohair, and extra-long staple cotton.One method of providing support is loans to and purchases from producers. With limited exceptions, loans made on commodities are nonrecourse. The commodities serve as collateral for the loan and on maturity the producer may deliver or forfeit such collateral to satisfy the loan obligation without further payment.Direct purchases may be made from processors as well as producers, depending on the commodity involved. Also, purchases are made under various laws; for example, the Act of August 19, 1958, as amended, and section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended.Commodity Payment Programs.--Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) payments are available for a wide variety of commodity crops.  The BBA added seed cotton as a covered commodity eligible for ARC and PLC. The BBA also removed generic base acres beginning with the 2018 crop year, and allowed producers to reallocate generic base acres to seed cotton, or other covered commodities eligible for ARC/PLC payments.Price Loss Coverage (PLC).--Payments are issued when the effective price of a covered commodity is less than the respective reference price for that commodity established in the statute. The payment is equal to 85 percent of the base acres of the covered commodity times the difference between the effective reference price and the effective price times the program payment yield for the covered commodity. The 2018 Farm Bill authorized a nationwide PLC yield update for the 2020 crop year.Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC).--There are two types: County ARC and Individual ARC.County ARC: Payments are issued when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is less than the ARC county guarantee for the covered commodity and are based on county data, not farm data. The ARC county guarantee equals 86 percent of the previous 5-year average national farm price, excluding the years with the highest and lowest price (the ARC guarantee price), times the 5-year average county yield, excluding the years with the highest and lowest yield (the ARC county guarantee yield). Both the guarantee and actual revenue are computed using base acres, not planted acres. The payment is equal to 85 percent of the base acres of the covered commodity times the difference between the county guarantee and the actual county crop revenue for the covered commodity. Payments may not exceed 10 percent of the benchmark county revenue (the ARC guarantee price times the ARC county guarantee yield).Individual ARC: Payments are issued when the actual individual crop revenues, summed across all covered commodities on the farm, are less than ARC individual guarantees summed across those covered commodities on the farm. The farm for individual ARC purposes is the sum of the producer's interest in all ARC farms in the State. The farm's ARC individual guarantee equals 86 percent of the farm's individual benchmark guarantee, which is defined as the ARC guarantee price times the 5-year average individual yield, excluding the years with the highest and lowest yields, and summing across all crops on the farm. The actual revenue is computed in a similar fashion, with both the guarantee and actual revenue computed using planted acreage on the farm. The individual ARC payment equals: a) 65 percent of the sum of the base acres of all covered commodities on the farm, times b) the difference between the individual guarantee revenue and the actual individual crop revenue across all covered commodities planted on the farm. Payments may not exceed 10 percent of the individual benchmark revenue.Election Required.--All of the producers on a farm must make an election of: 1) PLC/County ARC on a covered-commodity-by-covered-commodity basis; or 2) Individual ARC for all covered commodities on the farm. If the producers on the farm elect PLC/County ARC, the producers must also make a one-time election to select which base acres on the farm are enrolled in PLC and which base acres are enrolled in County ARC. Alternatively, if Individual ARC is selected, then every covered commodity on the farm must participate in Individual ARC. The 2018 Farm Bill authorized an annual election opportunity beginning in crop year 2021, with an initial election opportunity in 2019 for both the 2019 and 2020 crop years. Also, authorization for ARC and PLC was extended through the 2023 crop year.Adjusted Gross Income.--Adjusted gross income (AGI) provisions have been simplified and modified. Producers whose average AGI exceeds $900,000 during a crop, fiscal, or program year are not eligible to participate in most programs administered by FSA and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previous AGI provisions distinguished between farm and nonfarm AGI.Payment Limitations.--The total amount of payments received, directly and indirectly, by a person or legal entity (except joint ventures or general partnerships) for Price Loss Coverage and Agriculture Risk Coverage (other than for peanuts), may not exceed $125,000 per crop year. A person or legal entity that receives payments for peanuts has a separate $125,000 payment limitation. For the Supplemental Disaster Programs, a payment limit of $125,000 applies to payments under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP). The 2018 Farm Bill eliminated the payment limit for Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 eliminated the payment limits for Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) and the Tree Assistance Program (TAP).Marketing Assistance Loans (MALs) and Sugar Loans.--The 2018 Farm Bill extends the authority for sugar loans for the 2019 through 2023 crop years and nonrecourse marketing assistance loans (MALs) and loan deficiency payment (LDPs) for the 2019-2023 crops of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, extra-long staple cotton (eligible for loans only), long grain rice, medium grain rice, soybeans, other oilseeds (including sunflower seed, rapeseed, canola, safflower, flaxseed, mustard seed, crambe and sesame seed), dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, large chickpeas, graded and nongraded wool, mohair, honey, unshorn pelts, and peanuts. Availability of loans for some commodities may be affected by appropriations language. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-113) amended the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, allowing producers to receive certificates in lieu of marketing loan gains or loan deficiency payments starting with the 2015 crop marketing year.DAIRY PROGRAMSDairy Margin Coverage.--The 2018 Farm Bill authorized the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, which is a voluntary risk management program for dairy producers. The program provides payments to dairy producers when the difference between the all milk price and the average feed price (the margin) falls below a margin selected by the producer. Catastrophic coverage is available at no cost to the producers, other than an annual $100 administrative fee; and various levels of buy-up coverage that farmers may choose by paying premiums covering the dairy operation's production history, ranging from 5 percent to 95 percent of production.Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP).--The program provides payments to dairy producers when a public regulatory agency directs them to remove their raw milk from the commercial market because it has been contaminated by pesticides and other residues.PROGRAMS FOR BIOENEGY AND NON-COMMODITY CROPS Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP).--NAP provides coverage, similar to buy-up provisions offered under the Federal crop insurance program. Producers may elect coverage for each individual crop between 50 and 65 percent of production, in 5 percent increments, at 100 percent of the average market price. Producers also pay a fixed premium equal to 5.25 percent of the liability. The waiver of service fees has been expanded from just limited resource farmers to also include beginning farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers. The premiums for buy-up coverage are reduced by 50 percent for those same farmers.Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP).--BCAP provides incentives to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to establish, cultivate and harvest eligible biomass for heat, power, bio-based products, research and advanced biofuels. Crop producers and bioenergy facilities can team together to submit proposals to USDA for selection as a BCAP project area. The 2018 Farm Bill did provide an authorization to spend up to $25 million annually through FY 2023 but changed the funding source from CCC mandatory funds to discretionary funds subject to annual appropriation.Feedstock Flexibility Program (FFP).--FFP is continued through fiscal year 2023. Congress authorized the FFP in the 2008 Farm Bill, allowing for the purchase of sugar to be sold for the production of bioenergy in order to avoid forfeitures of sugar loan collateral under the Sugar Program.DISASTER PROGRAMSThe following four disaster programs were authorized by the 2008 Farm Bill under the USDA Supplemental Disaster Assistance Program. These programs were permanently re-authorized under CCC in the 2014 Farm Bill and modified in the 2018 Farm Bill.Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP).--LFP provides compensation to eligible livestock producers that have suffered grazing losses due to drought or fire on land that is native or improved pastureland with permanent vegetative cover or that is planted specifically for grazing. LFP payments for drought are equal to 60 percent of the monthly feed cost for up to 5 months, depending upon the severity of the drought. LFP payments for fire on federally managed rangeland are equal to 50 percent of the monthly feed cost for the number of days the producer is prohibited from grazing the managed rangeland, not to exceed 180 calendar days.Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP).--LIP provides benefits to livestock producers for livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality caused by adverse weather or by attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the Federal Government. LIP payments are equal to 75 percent of the average fair market value of the livestock. The BBA removed the payment limit for LIP and added provisions to provide benefits for the sale of animals at a reduced price if the sale occurred due to injury that was a direct result of an eligible adverse weather event or due to an attack by an animal reintroduced into the wild.Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish (ELAP).--ELAP provides emergency assistance to eligible producers of livestock, honeybees and farm-raised fish for losses due to disease (including cattle tick fever), adverse weather, or other conditions, such as blizzards and wildfires, not covered by LFP and LIP. The BBA removed the annual funding limitation of $20 million per program year and clarified which losses are eligible for assistance. The 2018 Farm Bill eliminated the payment limit for ELAP.Tree Assistance Program (TAP).--TAP provides financial assistance to qualifying orchardists and nursery tree growers to replant or rehabilitate eligible trees, bushes, and vines damaged by natural disasters. The BBA removed the payment limitation for TAP and increased the number of acres for which a producer can receive payment from 500 to 1,000 acres per year. In addition, the BBA expanded coverage under TAP by providing $15 million for 2017 pecan tree losses for growers who suffered a pecan mortality loss that exceeds 7.5 percent (rather than a mortality loss that exceeds 15 percent) due to an eligible natural disaster.FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMSMarket Access Program (MAP).--Under the MAP, CCC Funds are used to reimburse participating organizations for a portion of the costs of carrying out overseas marketing and promotional activities. The 2018 Farm Bill continues the authority for the MAP program with annual funding of $200 million for 2018-2023.Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program (FMD) and Quality Samples Program.--Under the FMD program, cost-share assistance is provided to nonprofit commodity and agricultural trade associations to support overseas market development activities that are designed to remove long-term impediments to increased U.S. trade. CCC will fund the Quality Samples Program at an authorized annual level of $2.5 million. Under this initiative, samples of U.S. agricultural products will be provided to foreign importers to promote a better understanding and appreciation for the high quality of U.S. products.Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops and Emerging Markets.--Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops and Emerging Markets were both extended through 2023 in the 2018 Farm Bill. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust.--The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT) is a commodity and/or monetary reserve designed to ensure that the United States can meet its international food aid commitments. Assets of the Trust can be released any time the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development determines that PL 480 Title II is inadequate to meet those needs in any fiscal year. When a release from the Trust is authorized, the Trust's assets cover all commodity costs associated with the release. All non-commodity costs, including ocean freight charges; internal transportation, handling, and storage overseas; and certain administrative costs are paid by CCC. The 2018 Farm Bill extends the authorization to replenish the BEHT through 2023.CONSERVATION PROGRAMSConservation Reserve Program (CRP).--The 2018 Farm Bill extended and modified the authorization of CRP through FY 2023. It limits the practice incentive payments to the actual cost of practice implementation and lowers the CRP soil rental payments to 85 percent of the rental rate for general program enrollment and 90 percent for continuous program enrollment. The acreage cap is increased from 24 million acres to 27 million acres by FY 2023. The 2018 Farm Bill also authorized up to $12 million in incentive payments for tree thinning and related activities.Transition Incentive Program (TIP).--The 2018 Farm Bill extended TIP through FY 2023. It authorized up to $50 million to encourage the transition of expiring CRP land to a beginning, socially disadvantaged, or veteran farmer or rancher so land can be returned to sustainable grazing or crop production.OPERATING EXPENSESThe Corporation carries out its functions through utilization of employees and facilities of other Government agencies. Administrative expenses are incurred by: the Farm Service Agency (FSA); the Foreign Agricultural Service; the Natural Resources Conservation Service; other agencies of the Department engaged in the Corporation's activities; and the Office of Inspector General for audit functions.  The table below summarizes some of the administrative expenses funded through the Corporation.  These funds are in addition to discretionary appropriations for these agencies.

These expenses are treated as program expenses. Such program expenses include inspection, classing, and grading work performed on a fee basis by Federal employees or Federal- or State-licensed inspectors; and special services performed by Federal agencies within and outside this Department. Most of these general expenses, including storage and handling, transportation, inspection, classing and grading, and producer storage payments, are included in program costs. They are shown in the program and financing schedule in the entries entitled ""Storage, transportation, and other obligations not included above.''Section 161 of the 1996 Act amended Section 11 of the CCC Charter Act to limit the use of CCC funds for the transfer and allotment of funds to State and Federal agencies. The Section 11 cap of $56 million remains in 2020 and 2021.The Corporation receives reimbursement for grain requisitioned pursuant to Public Law 87-152 by the States from Corporation stocks to feed resident wildlife threatened with starvation through the appropriation reimbursement for net realized losses. There have been no requisitions in recent years, however. The Corporation receives reimbursement for the commodity costs and other costs, including administrative costs, for commodities supplied to domestic nutrition programs and international food aid programs.FINANCINGAppropriations.--Reimbursement for Net Realized Losses. Under Section 2 of Public Law 87-155, the Act of August 17 1961 (15 U.S.C. 713a 11), annual appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year, commencing with 1961, to reimburse the Corporation for net realized losses. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 amended Public Law 87-155 to authorize that the Corporation is reimbursed for its net realized losses by means of a current, indefinite appropriation as provided in annual appropriations acts. Appropriations to the Corporation for net realized losses have no effect on budget authority, as they are used to repay debt directly with the Treasury.Borrowing authority.--The Corporation has an authorized capital stock of $100 million held by the U.S. Treasury and, effective in 1988, authority to have outstanding borrowings up to $30 billion at any one time. Funds are borrowed from the Treasury and may also be borrowed from private lending agencies and others. The Corporation reserves a sufficient amount of its borrowing authority to purchase at any time all notes and other obligations evidencing loans made to the Corporation by such agencies and others. All bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations issued by the Corporation are subject to approval by the Secretary of the Treasury as required by the Act of March 8, 1938.Interest on borrowings from the Treasury (and on capital stock) is paid at a rate based upon the average interest rate of all outstanding marketable obligations (of comparable maturity date) of the United States as of the preceding month. Interest is also paid on other notes and obligations at a rate prescribed by the Corporation and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Department of Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1966, made provision for terminating interest after June 30, 1964 on the portion of the Corporation's borrowings from the Treasury equal to the unreimbursed realized losses recorded on the books of the Corporation after the end of the fiscal year in which such losses are realized.Non-Expenditure Transfers.--The Commodity Credit Corporation transfers CCC funds to several agencies responsible for administering Farm Bill and other Corporation programs. Once transferred, the expenses are recorded in the receiving agencies accounts."

As of September 30, 2019, 5,281 state and Federal credit unions and 11 corporate credit unions were insured by the SIF, with insured member shares of $1.2 trillion--an increase of $72 billion, or six percent, year-on-year.Following a cost allocation method that distributes NCUA costs between its insurance and regulatory functions, the SIF reimburses the NCUA Operating Fund for its share of administrative costs. In calendar year 2019, the SIF paid reimbursements of approximately $183 million to the Operating Fund.On September 28, 2017, the NCUA Board voted unanimously to close the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund (TCCUSF) and to distribute the TCCUSF's remaining funds, property, and other assets to the SIF. Through the distribution, the SIF assumed the activities and obligations of the TCCUSF, including NCUA Guaranteed Notes (NGN). As of September 30, 2019, the outstanding principal balance of the NGNs was 3.4 billion. This amount represents the maximum potential, but not the expected cost, of future guaranteed payments that NCUA could be required to make under the program. The NCUA currently anticipates a total of $2.5 billion in NGN guarantee payments to be made through 2021, of which some payments will be made from the balances the NCUA manages as a fiduciary for certain failed corporate credit union estates. The final tranche of NGNs will mature in 2021.  The NCUA currently estimates that after all of the NGNs mature, the receivables due to the SIF from the estates of failed corporate credit unions will be equal to or greater than the amount of guarantee payments paid by the SIF .The SIF's normal operating level, which is the Fund's target capital level, remains at 1.38 percent of insured shares in 2020.For more information, please see the Credit and Insurance chapter in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget."

BEP began printing currency in 1862 and operates on the basis of authority conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury by 31 U.S.C. 321(a) (4) to engrave and print currency and other security documents. Operations are financed through a revolving fund established in 1950 in accordance with Public Law 81-656. The fund is reimbursed for direct and indirect costs of operations, including administrative expenses, through product sales. In 1977, Public Law 95-81 authorized BEP to include an amount sufficient to fund capital investment and to meet working capital requirements in the prices charged for products, eliminating the need for appropriations from Congress. In 2019, Public Law 116-6 authorized the use of the revolving fund for acquisition of necessary land for, and construction of, a replacement currency production facility.The Bureau has three strategic goals: to safely and timely deliver quality products to stakeholders in a cost-effective and environmentally responsible manner; to create innovative designs, processes, and products that exceed stakeholders' expectations and to achieve overall excellence by balanced investment in people, processes, facilities, and technology. Other activities at BEP include engraving plates and dies; manufacturing inks used to print security products; purchasing materials, supplies, equipment; and storing and delivering products in accordance with customer requirements. In addition, BEP provides technical assistance, advice, and production services to other Federal agencies in the development of security documents that require counterfeit deterrent features due to their innate value or other characteristics. BEP supports the Treasury goals to Boost U.S. Economic Growth and Achieve Operational Excellence.BEP's 2021 priorities include: (1) constructing a more efficient production facility to replace the current aging Washington, D.C. facility; (2) expanding the Western Currency Facility to house the new equipment required for the next generation of currency design; (3) conducting research and development, and collaborating with key stakeholders in order to deter counterfeiting and maintain public trust in the security and reliability of U.S. currency notes; (4) retooling manufacturing processes with state-of-the-art intaglio printing presses, electronic inspection systems, and finishing equipment; (5) continuing efforts to implement designated talent management initiatives while filling personnel gaps in needed STEM and cybersecurity skill sets. During 2021, BEP expects to produce and deliver 6.8 billion notes to the FRB to meet currency demand."

This business-like fund is used to pay all GPO costs in performing congressional and agency publishing, printing and information product procurement, publications dissemination and space sharing activities. It is reimbursed from payments from customer agencies, sales to the public, and transfers from GPO's two annual appropriations: the Congressional Publishing Appropriation and the Public Information Programs of the Superintendent of Documents Appropriation. GPO pays its expenses from the Fund and the Fund is reimbursed when the Treasury Department transfers money from customer agency accounts to the Fund when they pay GPO's invoices. This procedure also applies to the payment of transfers from the Congressional Publishing and Public Information Programs appropriations, and to deposits of funds collected from sales to the public. GPO maintains a cash balance in the Business Operations Revolving Fund that is used to pay all expenses. The cash balance fluctuates daily as payments are received from agency reimbursements, customer payments, and transfers from GPO appropriations. Under GPO's system of accrual accounting, annual earnings generated since the inception of the Fund have been accumulated as retained earnings. Retained earnings make it possible for GPO to fund a significant amount of technology modernization. However, appropriations for essential investments in technology and facilities upgrades are requested when necessary. GPO is accountable for its finances. Each year, the agency's finances and financial controls are audited by an independent outside audit firm working under contract with GPO's Office of Inspector General. For FY 2019 , the audit concluded with GPO earning an unmodified, or clean, opinion on its finances, the 23rd consecutive year GPO has earned such an audit result."

Prior to that time, many agencies borrowed directly from the private market to finance credit programs involving lending to the public at higher rates than on comparable Treasury securities. With the implementation of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 agencies finance such loan programs through direct loan financing accounts that borrow directly from the Treasury. The FFB finances these Federal direct loans to the public which are fully guaranteed by a Federal agency. FFB loans are also used to finance activities of the U.S. Postal Service.Lending by the FFB may take one of three forms, depending on the authorizing statutes pertaining to a particular agency or program: 1) the FFB may purchase agency financial assets; 2) the FFB may acquire debt securities that the agency is otherwise authorized to issue to the public; and 3) the FFB may originate direct loans on behalf of an agency by disbursing loans directly to private borrowers and receiving repayments from the private borrower on behalf of the agency. Because the law requires that transactions by the FFB be treated as a means of financing agency obligations, the budgetary effect of the third type of transaction is reflected in the Budget in the following sequence: a loan by the FFB to the agency, a loan by the agency to a private borrower, a repayment by a private borrower to the agency, and a repayment by the agency to the FFB.In 2019, FFB's net inflows were $337 million. In addition to its authority to borrow from the Treasury (Fiscal Service), the FFB has the statutory authority to borrow up to $15 billion from other sources. Any such borrowing is exempt from the statutory ceiling on Federal debt. The FFB used this authority most recently in October 2015.The following tables show (1) the annual net lending by the FFB by agency and program and the amount outstanding at the end of each year and (2) principal repayments from the borrower in excess of principal repaid to the Fiscal Service each year.NET LENDING AND LOANS OUTSTANDING, END OF YEAR(in millions of dollars) 2019 actual2020 est.2021 est.A.

The IAE leverages technology to reduce burden on awardees and provide immediate and reliable access to data and information federal officials need to plan for, award, and manage taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively. Analysis and use of data in the IAE environment has supported category management savings of over $27 billion since 2017 and elimination of over 31,000 duplicate contracts while exceeding small business contracting goals. Ongoing modernization considers the need for removing friction in processes, providing self-service tools to leverage data as a strategic asset, and exploring innovation to open more data while reducing taxpayer costs. In alignment with the IAE modernization work in 2020, the program is working to refine its financial model to better reflect a modernized award environment."

Expenses of the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) are financed from rental charges assessed to occupants of General Services Administration (GSA)-controlled space. Rent assessments, by law, approximate commercial rates for comparable space and services. Rental income is augmented by appropriations to the Fund when new construction needs exceed the resources available for investment within the Fund.The Budget requests $10,388 million in new obligational authority for the FBF. The Administration's proposal ensures that GSA spends at least at the level of anticipated rent that it collects from Federal departments and agencies in order to provide services to those customers.Historically, the FBF has been permitted to spend at least what it collects from agencies to support leasing from the private sector, as well as maintenance, repairs, major renovations, and new construction to accommodate agency needs in buildings that GSA owns and operates. However, in several recent years, the FBF appropriations were significantly below the anticipated level of rent collections from agencies, denying GSA the ability to pursue an appropriately-sized capital program relative to the size of its portfolio. By restoring the principle that the FBF should be allowed to spend what it collects and pursuing a robust capital program, the Administration hopes to accomplish a number of policy goals: avoiding larger, longer-term capital costs associated with deferring maintenance of Federal facilities; improving efficiency at GSA-owned facilities; and realizing a smaller Federal footprint through improved building utilization.The following table reports rent and other income to the Fund:[In millions of dollars] 2019 actual2020 est.2021 est.Rental charges9,96410,20410,388Collections for:(a) Special services and improvements1,5311,3551,360(b) Miscellaneous incomeTotal receipts and reimbursements11,49511,55811,748The following tables report the planned financing for the Fund in 2021:[In millions of dollars]   Obligational authority  End-of-year  From  unobligated  prior ObligationsbalanceTotalNewyear 2021 program:1.

Under the Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005, the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and its Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) were merged into the new DIF on March 31, 2006. Through the DIF, the FDIC resolves and recovers funds disbursed from the assets of failed institutions. The FDIC is authorized to charge risk-based premiums on member institutions to restore and maintain adequate fund reserves, defined as a designated percentage of estimated insured deposits set by the FDIC before the beginning of each year. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) (P.L. 111-203), enacted July 21, 2010, increased the minimum DIF reserve ratio (ratio of the DIF balance to total insured deposits) to 1.35 percent, up from 1.15 percent. In addition to raising the minimum reserve ratio, the Act also: 1) eliminated the FDIC's requirement to rebate premiums when the reserve ratio is between 1.35 and 1.5 percent; 2) gave the FDIC discretion to suspend or limit rebates when the DIF reserve ratio is at least 1.5 percent, effectively removing the 1.5 percent cap on the DIF; 3) required the FDIC to offset the effect on small insured depository institutions (defined as banks with assets less than $10 billion) when setting assessments to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15 to 1.35 percent; and 4) permanently increased the insured deposit level to $250,000 at banks insured by the FDIC. The FDIC Board has issued a final rule setting a long-term (greater than 10 years) reserve ratio target of 2 percent, with the goal of maintaining a positive fund balance during any future economic crises and maintaining a moderate, steady, long-term assessment rate that provides transparency and predictability to the banking sector.As of September 30, 2019, the DIF balance stood at $108.9 billion on an accrual basis, measuring expected losses to current balances. This level is equivalent to a reserve ratio of 1.41 percent. The growth in the DIF balance reflects projections of bank failures in line with historical experience and assessment revenue required to increase the reserve ratio over time.Pursuant to the Act, the restoration period for the DIF reserve ratio to reach 1.35 percent was extended to 2020. (Prior to the Act, the DIF reserve ratio was required to reach the minimum target of 1.15 percent by 2016.) The DIF reserve ratio reached the statutorily required level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2018, in accordance with FDIC regulation.For more information, please see the Credit and Insurance chapter in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget."

To carry out its responsibilities under this Act, the Board of Governors (Board) determines general monetary, credit, and operating policies for the System as a whole and formulates the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. The Board's principal duties consist of exerting an influence over credit conditions and supervising the Federal Reserve banks and member banks.Under the provisions of section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Board levies upon the Federal Reserve banks, in proportion to their capital and surplus, an assessment sufficient to pay its estimated expenses. Also under the Act, the Board determines and prescribes the manner in which its obligations are incurred and its expenses paid. Funds derived from assessments are deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Act provides that such funds ""not be construed to be Government funds or appropriated moneys.'' No Government appropriation is required to support operations of the Board.The Board issues U.S. currency (Federal Reserve notes) and the Reserve Banks distribute currency through depository institutions. The Board incurs costs and assesses the Reserve Banks for these costs related to producing, issuing, and retiring Federal Reserve notes, as well as providing other services. The assessment is allocated based on each Reserve Bank's share of the number of notes comprising the System's net liability for Federal Reserve notes on December 31 of the prior year. The Board recognizes the assessment in the year in which the associated costs are incurred.Since 2017, the Board has undertaken a greater role in the currency program, including in research and development and quality assurance. This expanded role is reflected in the reclassification of certain transactions compared to prior years. The information presented pertains to Board operations only, which includes these new programs; expenditures for the currency program costs specific to the work performed by Treasury, including production, issuance and retirement, are not included. The Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203), enacted July 21, 2010, directed the Board to collect assessments, fees, or other charges equal to the total expenses the Board estimates are necessary or appropriate to carry out the supervisory and regulatory responsibilities of the Board for certain bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, as well as nonbank financial companies designated for Board supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The Board does not recognize the supervision and regulation assessments as revenue nor does the Board use the collections to fund Board expenses; the funds are transferred to the Treasury. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA, P.L. 115-174), enacted May 24, 2018, directed the Board to collect these assessments, fees, or other charges on such companies with total consolidated assets of $100 billion (from $50 billion in the Dodd-Frank Act), as well as to adjust amounts charged to reflect changes in supervisory and regulatory responsibilities resulting from EGRRCPA on firms with total consolidated assets less than $250 billion."

WAPA operates and maintains about 17,000 circuit-miles of high-voltage transmission lines, more than 300 substations/switchyards and associated power system controls, and communication and electrical facilities for 15 separate power projects. WAPA also constructs additions and modifications to existing facilities.In keeping with statutory requirements, WAPA's long-term power contracts allow for periodic rate adjustments to ensure that the Federal Government recovers costs of operations, other costs allocated to power, and the capital investment in power facilities, with interest.Power is sold to nearly 700 wholesale customers, including DOE's National Labs, more than two dozen U.S. Department of Defense installations, municipalities, cooperatives, irrigation districts, public utility districts, other State and Federal Government agencies, and private utilities. Receipts are deposited in the Reclamation Fund, the Falcon and Amistad Operating and Maintenance Fund, the General Fund, the Colorado River Dam Fund, and the Colorado River Basins Power Marketing Fund.As in past years, the budget continues to provide funding for annual expenses and purchase power and wheeling expenses through discretionary offsetting collections derived from power receipts collected to recover those expenses.Systems Operation and Maintenance.--Provides essential electrical and communication equipment replacements and upgrades, capitalized moveable equipment, technical services, and supplies and materials necessary for safe reliable operation and cost-effective maintenance of the power systems.Purchase Power and Wheeling.--Provision is made for the payment of wheeling fees and for the purchase of electricity in connection with the distribution of power under contracts with utility companies. Customers are encouraged to contract for power and wheeling on their own, or use alternative funding mechanisms, including customer advances, net billing, and bill crediting to finance these activities. Ongoing operating services are also available on a reimbursable basis.WAPA has implemented a Purchase Power and Wheeling (PPW) risk mitigation strategy to ensure continuous operations during periods of significant drought. The strategy was developed consistent with existing authorities, and with the participation and support of WAPA power customers. Under this approach, WAPA retains receipts from the recovery of purchase power and wheeling expenses within the 'up to' amount specified by Congress. The receipts retained are available until expended, and are available only for purchase power and wheeling expenses.

WAPA's reimbursable authority and partnerships were demonstrated following the severe hurricane damage in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. WAPA responded to the urgent need to restore the energy infrastructure and access to power in the U.S. Virgin Islands and supported the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' emergency power restoration efforts in Puerto Rico. WAPA also supported responses to natural disasters in Hawaii (volcanic eruption), Guam (typhoon) and California (wild fires).WAPA will continue to spend out of the Colorado River Dam Fund for operations and maintenance activities associated with the Boulder Canyon Project via a reimbursable arrangement with the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation. The Colorado River Dam Fund is a revolving fund operated by the Bureau of Reclamation.

The Bankruptcy Judges, U.S. Trustees and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-554) expanded the pilot trustee program to a 21 region, nationwide program encompassing 88 judicial districts (bankruptcy cases filed in Alabama and North Carolina are administered by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts).  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, (P.L. 109-8) expanded the Program's responsibilities to include, among other things, means testing, credit counseling/debtor education, and debtor audits.  The August 2019 enactment of the Small Business Reorganization Act (P.L. 116-54) gave the Program additional responsibilities regarding small business debtors. USTP appropriations are offset by revenues deposited into the United States Trustee System Fund from filing fees paid by consumer and business debtors as well as quarterly fees based on disbursements made by chapter 11 debtors.  In October 2017, the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-72) was enacted, which adjusted quarterly fees for the largest chapter 11 debtors.  The amended fee structure was effective January 1, 2018 and applies for each fiscal year through 2022.  The fee schedule, however, will revert to the prior schedule for any fiscal year in which the balance of the Fund equals or exceeds a threshold amount as of the end of the prior fiscal year. Beginning in 2020, the threshold increased to $300 million (as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, P.L. 116-93).  As a result, the Program's 2021 appropriation is anticipated to be fully offset by bankruptcy fees collected and on deposit in the United States Trustee System Fund if the amended fee structure is in effect for the year."

In recent years, fewer than 5 percent of individuals have elected to make this designation, resulting in less than $30 million being paid into the PECF annually.The Department of the Treasury collects the income tax designations and makes distributions from the PECF to qualified presidential candidates and to the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund. Money for the public funding of presidential election campaigns can only come from the PECF; if the PECF were to exhaust its fund balances, no other public funding could be used.The Federal Election Commission administers the public funding program, determines which candidates are eligible, the amount to which they are entitled, and audits their use of the funds. Current uses of the PECF are provided below.Matching Funds for Presidential Primary Candidates.--Upon certification by the Federal Election Commission and based on a demonstration of broad national support, adherence to spending limits, and other qualifications, every eligible presidential primary candidate is entitled to receive $250 in Federal matching funds for the first eligible $250 of private contributions received from an individual. The private contributions must be received after the beginning of the calendar year immediately preceding the election year through the end of the calendar year of the election. For the 2016 Presidential election, $1,679,865 was paid out to two eligible candidates ($1,544,965 in 2016 and $134,900 in 2017).Candidates for General Elections.--By statute, eligible candidates of each major party in a presidential election are entitled to equal payments in an amount that may not exceed $20 million (adjusted for inflation since 1974) per party. In 2016, this amounted to $96.1 million for each candidate, but neither major party candidate accepted general election funding. Eligibility for this funding depends on meeting several criteria, such as agreeing to limit spending to amounts specified by campaign finance laws. In addition, candidates from new parties, minor parties, and non-major parties who receive in excess of 5 percent of the popular vote may be entitled to a pro rata portion of the major party amount in the general election.10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund.--On April 3, 2014, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (Public Law 113-94) was enacted. The Act established the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund and directs that certain PECF moneys be transferred to that Fund."

By carrying out the mandates of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), DEA ensures that adequate supplies of controlled drugs are available to meet legitimate medical, scientific, industrial, and export needs, while preventing, detecting, and eliminating diversion of these substances to illicit traffic. The CSA requires physicians, pharmacists, and chemical companies to register with the DEA in order to distribute or manufacture controlled substances or listed chemicals. The registrant community, physicians, prescribers, and pharmacists, can be seen as the first line of defense against the opioid epidemic now facing the United States. The engagement and education of these community members can help in reducing the overprescribing of opioids and the prevention of abuse and illicit use. Investigations conducted by the Diversion Control Program fall into two distinct categories: the diversion of legitimately manufactured pharmaceutical controlled substances and the diversion of controlled chemicals (List I and II) used in the illicit manufacture of controlled substances. DEA's objectives for diversion control include:--Identifying and targeting those responsible for the diversion of pharmaceutical controlled substances through traditional investigation and cybercrime initiatives to systematically disrupt and dismantle those entities involved in diversion schemes;--Supporting the registrant population with improved technology, including e-commerce and customer support, while maintaining cooperation, support, and assistance from the regulated industry;--Educating the public on the dangers of prescription drug abuse and proactive enforcement measures to combat emerging drug trends; and,--Ensuring an adequate and uninterrupted supply of pharmaceutical controlled substances and listed chemicals to meet legitimate medical, commercial, and scientific needs."

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357) allowed the IRS to use private collection contractors to supplement its own collection staff efforts to ensure that all taxpayers pay what they owe. The statute authorized the Treasury to retain and use an amount not in excess of 25 percent of the amount collected under any qualified tax collection contract for payments to private collection agents, and an amount not in excess of 25 percent of the amount collected for enforcement activities of the IRS (26 USC 6306). The IRS used this authority to contract with several private debt collection agencies starting in 2006. In March 2009, the IRS allowed its private debt collection contracts to expire, thereby administratively terminating the program in accordance with Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 Administrative Provisions - Internal Revenue Service, Section 106 (P.L. 111-8). This provision stated that none of the funds made available in this Act maybe used to enter into, renew, extend, administer, implement, enforce, or provide oversight of any qualified tax collection contract as defined in section 6306 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.Section 32102(a) of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-94), amended section 6306 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and requires the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into one or more qualified tax collection contracts for the collection of all outstanding inactive tax receivables. These agreements are applicable to tax receivables as identified by the Secretary after December 4, 2015. Section 6306 of the IRC prohibits the payment of fees for all services in excess of 25 percent of the amount collected under a tax collection contract for payments to private collection agents. In addition, up to 25 percent of the amount collected may be used to fund the special compliance personnel program account under section 6307.Inactive tax receivables, as redefined by the Taxpayer First Act (P.L. 116-25), are defined as any tax receivable: 1) removed from the active inventory for lack of resources or inability to locate the taxpayer; 2) for which more than two years has passed since assessment and no IRS employee has been assigned to collect the receivable; or 3) for which a receivable has been assigned for collection but more than 365 days have passed without interaction with the taxpayer or a third party for purposes of furthering the collection. Tax receivables are defined as any outstanding assessment that the IRS includes in potentially collectible inventory. The Taxpayer First Act also made certain receivables of individual taxpayers ineligible for collection, including taxpayers whose income subtantially consists of disability insurance benefits or supplemental security income benefits or whose adjusted gross income does not exceed 200 percent of the applicable federal poverty level.

Auction receipts associated with the reallocated spectrum are deposited into the SRF to pay eligible pre- and post-auction costs that help efficiently and effectively transition Federal agencies off of the reallocated spectrum or facilitate the sharing of Federal systems with non-Federal systems. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administers the SRF in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce. In 2015, a portion of receipts associated with the Advanced Wireless Services 3 (AWS-3) auction, which reallocates Federal and other spectrum for flexible commercial use, were deposited into the SRF. Funds from the AWS-3 auction are being transferred to agencies with approved transition plans to reimburse them for the costs associated with clearing or sharing the auctioned bands. Transfers were made in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 and will continue in future years. Most funds in the SRF must be returned to the Treasury eight years after they are deposited.The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015, part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, authorized the transfer to agencies of up to $500 million of SRF balances, and a portion of future deposits into the SRF, to fund advance planning and research projects that are expected to facilitate future spectrum auctions. OMB, NTIA, and the Federal Communications Commission have approved projects totaling $400 million through the end of 2019."

The balance in the Reserve Fund may not exceed $100 million. Amounts in the Reserve Fund are available until expended. (The remainder of registration fee collections for each fiscal year are deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and are not available for obligation by the Commission.)Amounts collected and deposited in the Reserve Fund are not subject to appropriation or apportionment. However, the Commission is required to notify the Congress of the amount and purpose of any obligations made utilizing amounts from the Reserve Fund within 10 days.The 2021 Budget proposes to eliminate the Reserve Fund in 2022. Registration fees currently deposited in the Reserve Fund would be redirected to the general fund of the Treasury."

The intent is to elicit high-quality tips by motivating persons with knowledge of possible securities laws violations to assist the Federal Government in identifying and prosecuting individuals who violate the Federal securities laws.To comply with direction provided in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC's Division of Enforcement established an Office of the Whistleblower to administer and enforce the whistleblower award program. The Investor Protection Fund (the Fund), established by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides resources for payments to whistleblowers and for the SEC's Office of the Inspector General Employee Suggestion Program. Deposits into the Fund are comprised of a portion of monetary sanctions collected by the SEC in judicial or administrative actions brought by the Commission under the Federal securities laws that are not added to a disgorgement fund or other fund under section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-204), as well as amounts in such funds that will not be distributed to injured investors. No sanction collected by the Commission can be deposited into the Fund if the balance at the time the sanction is collected exceeds $300 million. No funds have been taken or withheld from harmed investors to pay whistleblower awards. The Commission is required to submit an annual report on the whistleblower award program to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.The figures reported for 2020 and 2021 are based on assumptions regarding several variables inherent to litigation and to the Commission's whistleblower award process. Given the potential for significant variation in the payouts and their timing, it is possible that actual payouts will be either significantly higher or significantly lower than these estimates."

The UTF has two accounts for the railroad unemployment insurance system but for the Federal-State unemployment insurance system there are 57 separate accounts: one for each of the 50 states, three jurisdictions (District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands) and four federal accounts. The state and jurisdiction accounts receive funds from a state unemployment insurance payroll tax which is used to pay benefits. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) payroll tax provides funds for two of the Federal accounts -- the Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) and the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) -- while the remaining two, the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) and the Federal Employee Compensation Account (FECA), are revolving accounts.Except for FECA balances, funds on deposit in the UTF accounts are invested in Government securities until needed for payment of benefits or administrative expenses. The FUTA payroll tax is deposited in the ESAA which retains 80 percent of the deposit and pays the costs of Federal and State administration of the unemployment insurance system, veterans' employment services, surveys of wages and employment, foreign labor certifications and about 97 percent of the costs of the Employment Service. The other 20 percent of FUTA is transferred to the EUCA which pays for certain extended benefit (EB) payments. During periods of high State unemployment, there is a stand-by program of EB, financed one-half by State unemployment taxes and one-half by the FUTA payroll tax.The UTF also provides repayable advances (loans) from the FUA to States and jurisdictions when the balances in their individual accounts are insufficient to pay benefits. Federal accounts in the UTF may receive repayable and nonrepayable advances from the general fund when they have insufficient balances to make advances to States, pay the Federal share of extended unemployment benefits, or pay for State and Federal administrative costs.The Federal Employees Compensation Account (FECA) in the UTF provides funds to States for unemployment compensation benefits paid to eligible former Federal civilian personnel, Postal Service employees, and ex-servicemembers. In turn, the various Federal agencies reimburse the FECA for benefits paid to their former employees. The FECA is not funded out of Federal unemployment taxes. Any additional resources necessary to assure that the FECA can make the required payments to States are provided from the Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds appropriation.Both the benefit payments and administrative expenses of the separate unemployment insurance program for railroad employees are paid from the UTF, and receipts from a tax on railroad payrolls are deposited into the program's accounts in the UTF to meet expenses."

Liquidating cash appropriations are subsequently requested to fund outlays resulting from obligations incurred under contract authority. As part of the Administration's 10-year surface transportation reauthorization proposal, the Budget requests $602 billion in contract authority for the FAH program over 10 years. Of this amount, $50.7 billion is requested for 2021, an 8 percent increase from 2020. This schedule reflects 2021 contract authority and obligation limitation equal to the baseline.

The fund has three sources of income. The first is payments from the military personnel accounts, which cover the accruing costs of the future retirement benefits being earned by today's service members. The second source is interest on investments of the fund. The third source is made up of two payments from the general fund of the Treasury. The first Treasury payment covers a portion of the accrued unfunded liability for all the retirees and current members who had earned benefits before the accrual funding system was set up. The second Treasury payment covers the liability for concurrent receipt of military retired pay and disability compensation paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This benefit was added in the 2004 National Defense Authorization Act.The 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 114-92) enacted substantial changes to the current military retirement system. The new retirement system, which took effect January 1, 2018 is a blend of several components, including a defined retired pay benefit, a defined contribution to the Thrift Savings Plan, and a bonus (continuation pay) paid to the member to maintain Service retention requirements. Currently serving members will remain grandfathered under the legacy retirement system.The status of the fund is as follows:"

These monies are expended to pay compensation, medical, and survivor benefits to eligible miners and their survivors, where mine employment terminated prior to 1970 or where no mine operator can be assigned liability. In addition, the fund pays all administrative costs incurred in the operation of Part C of the Black Lung program. The fund is administered jointly by the Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, enacted on October 3, 2008, authorized restructuring of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (BLDTF) debt by (1) extending the current coal excise tax rates of $1.10 per ton on underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton on surface-mined coal until December 31, 2018; (2) providing a one-time appropriation for the BLDTF to repay the market value of parts of the outstanding repayable advances and accrued interest; and (3) refinancing the remainder of the outstanding debt through the issuance of zero-coupon bonds, to be retired using the BLDTF's annual operating surplus until all of its remaining obligations have been paid.Note.-- Between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, the coal excise tax rates on underground-mined coal were $0.50 per ton or 2 percent of the sales price (whichever is lower) and $0.25 per ton or 2 percent of the sales price (whichever is lower) on surface-mined coal. Congress restored the tax rates on underground-mined coal of $1.10 per ton or 2 percent of the sales price (whichever is lower) and $0.55 per ton or 2 percent of the sales price (whichever is lower) on surface-mined coal from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND WORKLOAD 2019 actual2020 proj.2021 proj.Number of Claims Received6,8067,0007,000Number of Trust Fund Beneficiaries13,25712,80012,350Number of Beneficiaries Paid by Responsible Operators5,3865,6505,900"

This appropriation supports core Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs.To preserve and restore land and to protect human health and the environment, EPA reduces the risks posed by releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants, and protects against unacceptable exposure by cleaning up contaminated sites and restoring ground water to beneficial use. EPA applies the most effective and scientifically sound methods to address the risks associated with the presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants, improve response capabilities, and maximize the effectiveness of response and cleanup actions. Cleanup and response activity at contaminated sites addresses environmental concerns, such as the removal of contaminated soil and treatment of contaminated groundwater, to reduce human exposures to hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants, and to provide long-term human health protection. EPA works to ensure that all releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants into the environment are appropriately addressed by responding to incidents and providing technical support. To prepare for and respond to incidents of national significance, EPA includes among its efforts improving decontamination readiness. EPA conducts research to improve methods and models and to accelerate scientifically defensible and cost-effective decisions for cleanup at complex contaminated sites in accordance with CERCLA. EPA also works to maximize responsible parties' participation in site cleanups and pursue greater recovery of EPA's cleanup costs.EPA protects communities and helps return contaminated properties to productive use by ensuring that responsible parties pay for and/or conduct cleanups. The enforcement program recovers Federal cleanup funds from responsible parties to save taxpayer dollars. The goal is to maximize the participation of liable and viable parties in performing and paying for cleanups in both the remedial and removal programs. EPA investigates and refers for prosecution criminal and civil violations of CERCLA.EPA's internal operations programs provide centralized management services to ensure that EPA is fulfilling its mission. The offices and the functions they perform within the Superfund appropriation are: the Office of Mission Support (facilities infrastructure and operations; acquisition management; human resources management services; grant and interagency agreement management; suspension and debarment; exchange network; information security; and information technology/data management); the Office of Chief Financial Officer (strategic planning, annual planning and budgeting, financial services, and financial management, analysis, and accountability); and the Office of General Counsel (legal advice). Because these centralized services provide support across EPA, the internal operations programs are funded across EPA's appropriations. "

This appropriation supports core Agency programs.EPA's Oil Spill program protects U.S. waters by preventing, preparing for, responding to, and monitoring oil discharges. Under the regulatory framework established by the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and Federal Response Plan (FRP) regulations, EPA conducts oil spill prevention, preparedness, inspection, and enforcement activities associated with more than 600,000 non-transportation-related oil storage facilities. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) identifies EPA's jurisdiction over inland oil spills and sets forth the framework for response. EPA accesses the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, administered by the U.S. Coast Guard, to obtain reimbursement for site-specific spill response activities. More than 30,000 oil and hazardous substance discharges occur in the United States every year, with a significant portion of these discharges occurring in the inland zone over which EPA has jurisdiction.EPA develops and manages the regulations and protocols under Subpart J of the NCP which require manufacturers of various oil spill response products to test their products prior to listing on a Product Schedule. The Product Schedule identifies those oil spill remediation agents, such as dispersants and surface washing agents, which could be authorized for use by an On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) on an oil discharge. Product testing ensures their effectiveness and provides toxicity information used by OSCs and Regional Response Teams in making informed decisions regarding the use of certain products in response to specific spills. EPA focuses its oil spill research efforts on human health impacts, ecological effects, and shoreline and coastal impacts from oil discharges and use of dispersants and other chemical agents, as well as spill remediation alternatives and innovative technology development and evaluation, including green technologies. Spill response is a priority for the Agency, and EPA has been instrumental in providing guidance for various response technologies. A key factor in providing guidance on spill response technologies is developing a firm understanding of the science behind spill behavior in the environment.Appropriated funds for the Inland Oil Spill Programs support work designed to prevent oil spills using civil enforcement and compliance assistance approaches, as well as to prepare for and respond to any oil discharges affecting the inland waters of the United States. Pursuant to Clean Water Act section 311 (Oil Spill and Hazardous Substances Liability) requirements, EPA's Civil Enforcement program develops policies; issues administrative clean-up and removal orders and orders protecting public health; pursues administrative remedies and/or refers civil judicial actions to the Department of Justice; assesses civil penalties for discharges into the environment or violations of administrative orders or oil pollution prevention regulations; assists regulated entities in understanding their legal requirements under the Clean Water Act; and assists in the recovery of clean-up costs expended by the Government. The Budget proposes to institute a voluntary fee whereby owners and/or operators of oil facilities can choose to pay EPA for on-site compliance assistance with SPCC and FRP regulations. The collected fees will be deposited in the Inland Oil Spill Programs Account and used by EPA to pay for the service.EPA's internal operations programs provide centralized management services to ensure that EPA is fulfilling is mission. The office and function is Office of Mission Support (facilities infrastructure and operations)."

Section 7(b)(9) of the Railroad Retirement Act contains language requiring that all employees of the RRB, except for one assistant for each Board Member, must be hired under the competitive civil service. Elimination of this requirement would enable the RRB to use various hiring authorities offered by the Office of Personnel Management; the second legislative proposal is to amend the Railroad Retirement Act to allow the Railroad Retirement Board to utilize student and recent graduate hiring authority available to other Federal agencies; lastly the third legislative proposal is to amend the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to include a felony charge for individuals committing fraud against the Agency. Under this proposal, both the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act would be amended to include a felony charge similar to violations under 42 U.S.C. 408, 18 U.S.C. 1001, or 18 U.S.C. 287."

Starting in 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization funded it as a mandatory program supported by overflight fees under the EAS and Rural Airport Improvement Fund. In addition to mandatory funding supported by overflight fees, direct appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to Payments to Air Carriers have been enacted every year beginning in 2002 to meet the needs of the essential air service program. The 2021 Budget proposes to reform the EAS program to ensure Federal funds are efficiently targeted at the communities most in need. The reforms limit EAS eligibility to communities receiving subsidized service in 2020; increase the subsidy cap from $200 to $250 per passenger for communities located within 210 miles of a large or medium hub airport; eliminate the subsidy waiver for this requirement; and propose a 10 percent cost share for communities that do not meet certain eligibility requirements."

the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) programs, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, the Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans program, and certain health insurance functions for the aged and disabled. Public Law 114-10 prohibits displaying, coding, or embedding Social Security numbers on a beneficiary's Medicare card. In order to fund implementation costs to comply with this provision, SSA received $98 million funded incrementally from FY 2015 to FY 2018.The request in 2021 for program integrity activities builds on SSA's success in reducing program costs by ensuring that only individuals still eligible for benefits continue to receive them. The agency uses continuing disability reviews (CDR) to determine whether an individual continues to qualify for DI and/or the SSI program. SSA estimates that medical CDRs conducted in FY 2021 will yield a return on investment (ROI) of about $8 on average in net Federal program savings over 10 years per $1 budgeted for dedicated program integrity funding, including OASDI, SSI, Medicare and Medicaid program effects. Similarly, SSA estimates indicate that SSI non-medical redeterminations conducted in FY 2021 will yield a ROI of about $3 on average of net Federal program savings over 10 years per $1 budgeted for dedicated program integrity funding, including SSI and Medicaid program effects.The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act (BBEDCA) of 1985, as amended, authorizes adjustments to the discretionary spending limits through 2021 for administrative program integrity activities at the Social Security Administration. The Budget includes the authorized $1,302 million cap adjustment for 2021. To ensure full funding of the cost increases, this cap adjustment is permissible only if the base level for CDRs and SSI redeterminations is funded at $273 million. The cap adjustment may also fund cooperative disability investigation units, and Special Assistant U.S. Fraud Attorneys. To continue to support these important anti-fraud activities, appropriations language provides for SSA to transfer up to $11.2 million to the SSA Office of the Inspector General to fund CDI unit team leaders. SSA will conduct 690,000 full medical CDRs and approximately 2.0 million SSI redeterminations of eligibility in 2021. With access to program integrity cap adjustment levels, SSA is on track to remain current with program integrity workloads throughout the budget window. See additional discussion in the Budget Process chapter in the Analytical Perspectives volume.The Budget proposes offsetting collections from fees for replacement Social Security cards (estimated at $270 million in FY 2021).

Under current law, revenue is derived from a 0.125 percent ad valorem tax imposed upon commercial users of specified U.S. ports, Saint Lawrence Seaway tolls, and investment interest. The Budget proposes to execute these appropriations within the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund rather than to transfer and execute them in the Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Mississippi River and Tributaries accounts.The Harbor Maintenance Revenue Act authorizes expenditures from this fund to finance up to 100 percent of eligible Corps harbor operation and maintenance costs, including the operation and maintenance of Great Lakes navigation projects. The fund fully finances eligible operation and maintenance costs of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. The Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-303, section 201) authorizes the fund to pay the Federal share of the costs for the construction of dredged material disposal facilities that are necessary for the operation and maintenance of coastal or inland harbors, the dredging and disposal of contaminated sediments that are in or affect the operation and maintenance of Federal navigation channels, the mitigation of impacts resulting from Federal navigation operation and maintenance activities, and the operation and maintenance of dredged material disposal facilities.The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (26 U.S.C. 9505(c)(3)) authorizes the fund to pay all expenses of administration incurred by the Department of the Treasury, the Corps, and the Department of Commerce related to the administration of the harbor maintenance tax (under 26 U.S.C. 4461 et seq.), but not in excess of $5 million for any fiscal year.In 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court excluded all U.S. exports from the harbor maintenance tax. The Court found that the tax violated Article I, section 9, clause 5 of the constitution because the value of the cargo, which is the basis for calculating this tax, does not fairly match the use of port services and facilities by exporters.The Budget provides $50 million in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund only for eligible harbor maintenance emergency response work under Public Law 84-99, as amended (33 U.S.C. 701n), arising after the date of enactment of an appropriations act for the Corps covering all of fiscal year 2021, resulting from major disasters declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.). If the Corps has not been able to obligate this emergency response funding by the end of the fiscal year, it may use these funds in the following fiscal year for other eligible harbor maintenance work. The proposed appropriations language for eligible operation and maintenance costs for inland harbors on the lower Mississippi River is intended to only apply to: Helena Harbor, Phillips County, AR; Baton Rouge Harbor, Devil Swamp, LA; Greenville Harbor, MS; Vicksburg Harbor, MS; and Memphis Harbor, McKellar Lake, Memphis, TN."

It began the advance of the rights of women and minorities in the U.S., and sowed the seeds for international conflicts for a century, many of which are ongoing today. America's support of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and its other allies in World War I marked the first time in United States history that American soldiers went abroad in defense of liberty against foreign aggression. 4.7 million men and women from the United States served in uniform during World War I, among them 2 future presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Two million individuals from the United States served overseas during World War I, including 200,000 naval personnel who served on the seas.

Agencies are required to collect rental charges from employees who occupy Government-owned housing and quarters. This housing is provided only in isolated areas or where an employee is required to live on-site at a Federally owned facility or reservation.Forest ecosystems health and recovery.--The Forest Ecosystems Health and Recovery Fund was established as a permanent appropriation in the FY 1993 Interior Appropriations Act (Public Law 102-381).  This authority was subsequently amended to temporarily expand the use of the Fund to cover additional forest health and recovery activities.  The most recent reauthorization was included in the FY 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (Public Law 113-235) and expires at the end of FY 2020.  The FY 2021 President's Budget proposes language to extend the authority for the FEHRF to continue to be used for the broader forest health and recovery activities.  The proposal extends this authority for five years.  Without this reauthorization, funds in the FEHRF could only be used for the limited purposes provided for in the original FEHRF authorization.  Funds in this account are derived from revenue generated from the Federal share of receipts from the sale of salvage timber from the Oregon and California grant lands, public domain lands, and Coos Bay Wagon Road lands. Pursuant to Public Law 102-381, as amended, this account was established to allow the BLM to more efficiently and effectively address forest health issues. Funds can be used for other forest health purposes, including vegetation and density control treatments. Timber sale pipeline restoration fund.--This Fund provides for the deposit and use of fees collected by the BLM for sales of timber authorized by section 2001(k) of Public Law 104-19. Of the total deposited into this account, 75 percent is to be used for the preparation of timber sales to fill the timber pipeline on lands administered by the BLM, and 25 percent is to be used to address recreation projects on the BLM lands.Stewardship contract product sales.--Stewardship contracting improves, maintains, or restores forest and rangeland health; restores or maintains water quality; improves fish and wildlife habitat; reestablishes native plant species and increases their resilience to insects and disease; and reduces hazardous fuels that pose risks to communities and ecosystem values. With stewardship contracting, the BLM may apply the value of timber or other forest products removed as an offset against the cost of services received, and monies from a contract may be retained by the BLM. These monies are available for expenditure without further appropriation at project sites.Expenses, road maintenance deposits.--Users of certain roads under the BLM's jurisdiction make deposits for maintenance purposes. Moneys collected are appropriated for necessary road maintenance. Moneys collected on Oregon and California grant lands are available only for those lands (43 U.S.C. 1762(c), 43 U.S.C. 1735(b)).Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, BLM.--The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) was enacted on December 8, 2004, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2005. All recreation fee receipts collected under this authority at BLM sites are deposited in the Recreation Fee account. The BLM returns 100 percent of these receipts back to the site where the fees were generated. The budget proposes to reauthorize FLREA, which expires October 1, 2021. As a precaution, the budget also proposes appropriations language to provide a 2-year extension of FLREA through September 2023.

A portion of revenue from new leases on the site is authorized to be deposited to this account. In 2008, it was certified that sufficient funds had been collected to cover the cost of the cleanup and other expenses and no more deposits were to be made to the Fund. New revenue from site operations is distributed under the Mineral Leasing Act.BLM Permit Processing Improvement Fund.--The 2005 Energy Policy Act, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, established pilot offices to improve interagency coordination in processing onshore Federal oil and gas permits. Fifty-percent of the rents from non-geothermal onshore mineral leases are authorized to be deposited in this Fund and used to facilitate the BLM oil and gas permit processing in these pilot offices. In addition, in 2016 through 2026, fees collected for processing applications for permits to drill will be deposited to this Fund.Federal land disposal.--The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, Public Law 106-248 (114 Stat. 613), provided authority for the BLM to sell public lands classified as suitable for disposal under resource management plans in effect at the time of enactment. This law provided that receipts from such sales could be used to acquire non-Federal lands with significant resource values that fall within the boundaries of areas now managed by the Department of the Interior. This authority expired on July 25, 2010, and was later reauthorized through July 25, 2011. All funds not obligated by both expiration dates were transferred to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
